<p>&#8220;Either we are all citizens of the same city and war
between us, a civil war, a monstrous iniquity to be forgotten,
as soon as it may bring in peace; or else there is no city

no place where they can together be at rest.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times Literary

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword">One</span> kind of German has been too often described, and
not infrequently invented. I propose here to
describe the other German. At a military hospital a
lady visitor said to the wounded soldiers: &#8220;We&#8217;ve
had lots of books and tales of horror; why don&#8217;t some
of you fellows prepare a book of the good deeds of the
enemy?&#8221; There was a slight pause. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; said
one of the soldiers, &#8220;that would be a golden book.&#8221;
Very imperfectly, and in spite of all the barriers
raised by war passions, I have tried to collect some of
the materials already to hand for such a book.</p>

<p>In any quarrel it is difficult to recognise that there
is good in one&#8217;s opponent. Yet in order that any
strife may be wisely settled, this recognition is
plainly necessary. Mere enmity, without recognition
of good, belongs to primitive barbarism. It was
against the foolish unpracticality of this older
barbarism (not surely only against its wickedness)
that Christ protested in the words, &#8220;But I say unto
you, love your enemies.&#8221; He saw around him the
folly and unenlightenment of the perpetual feud. I
have collected the testimonies that are in the following
pages because such facts seem to me to need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>wider recognition, if we are ever to gain an outlook
upon a fairer and a truer world.</p>

<p>If my desire for peace has anywhere shown itself
unduly, or in a way irritating to others, I ask forgiveness.
Whenever peace is made, the world will need
a peace built on all the facts of human nature. I
have tried to give here some of those which war
passions inevitably obscure. That is the whole of my
task.</p>

MILITARY PRISONERS.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword">The</span> cases of bad treatment of prisoners in Germany
have been made known very widely. No one, I
imagine, can wish to defend bad treatment of
prisoners anywhere (even of criminal prisoners), and
such a horrible state of things as that of Wittenberg
during the typhus epidemic is a disgrace to human
nature.</p>

<p>But Mr. Lithgow Osborne says: &#8220;My whole
impression of the camp authorities at Wittenberg was
utterly unlike that which I have received in every
other camp I have visited in Germany.&#8221; (Miscel. 16,
1916, p.&nbsp;6). I propose to give some account of
these other camps. I shall not exclude adverse
criticism, but as the public have heard little but such
criticism, I do not think it will be unfair to deal in
these pages more fully with the favourable reports.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letters from Officers and Others.</span></h3>

<p>The following letter from a British Officer appeared
in the <i>Times</i> of December 30, 1914. It may well
serve as an introduction and a caution:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p class="withsig">I do not doubt Private O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s wonderful experience
as a prisoner, but his is, I am sure, only an isolated case,
and not at all the usual treatment to which British prisoners
are subjected. I can speak from experience, as I, too, was a
prisoner (wounded), but afterwards released, as the building
in which I was, along with several German wounded, was
captured by the British. During the time I was with the
Germans they treated me with every consideration. Food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>was scarce, owing to the fact that the roads were so well
shelled by our artillery that their transport could not come
up; but they shared their food with me. They also dressed
my wound with the greatest care, and in every way made
me as comfortable as possible. Being able to speak a little
German, I talked to the other wounded, and found that
their papers also published dreadful tales of our treatment
of prisoners, which I am glad to say I was able to refute.
<br />I am, Sir, yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">A British Officer.</span></p>

<p>I would especially call the attention of fair-minded
men to the last sentences.</p>

<p>Here is a letter written by Second-Lieut. F. Phillips
Pearce (aged 18) of the 2nd Essex Regiment, from
Crefeld on October 27, and printed in the <i>Times</i> of
November 19, 1914:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>We are treated very well indeed here. We have good beds
and fires in the rooms, three good meals a day, and a French
soldier for a servant, and this morning I had a splendid hot
bath. We have roll call twice a day, at 8 a.m. and 9.45
p.m., and lights out at 10.45, and we have a large courtyard
to walk about in. We have a canteen here where we can
buy clothes and anything we want. Prison fare is very good&mdash;new
rolls and coffee and fresh butter. Not bad! I had a
very decent guard when I was coming up on the train; he
got me food, and when one man tried to get in to attack
me he threw him off the train. I am afraid I am out of the
firing line until the war ends (worse luck). I am in no danger
of being shot unless I try to bolt, which I shan&#8217;t do. I shot
the man who was carrying their colours, and he wanted to
have me shot, but luckily nobody seemed to agree with him.
The next time I saw him he had been bandaged up&mdash;he was
shot through the shoulder&mdash;and he dashed up and shook me
by the hand and shouted, &#8220;Mein Freund, mein Freund.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>On November 25 other letters appeared in the
<i>Times</i>. One was from a cavalry subaltern in a
German fortress:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>You ask about money; they provide lights and firing and
all the men&#8217;s food. The officers get 16s. a week and buy their
own. Quite sufficient, as it is cheap. I have learnt German
fairly quickly and do interpreter now in the shop for the
men, though, I am afraid, <i>tant mal que bien</i>. One of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>officials here used to be a professor, and is very kind trying
to teach us. Thanks for the warm underclothes, and most
awfully for the footballs. We have quite good matches....
It is better not to try to send any public news of
any kind from England; people having been stupid trying
to smuggle letters in cakes and things, and it only makes
trouble for everyone.</p></div>

<p>A Captain writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>For dinner at 1 p.m. we are given soup, meat and
vegetables.... Supper takes place at 7 o&#8217;clock and consists
of tea, sausages or meat and potatoes.... We
receive &pound;5 a month as pay, of which 1s. 6d. is deducted for
food each day. We have a canteen here at which we can
buy everything we want, ... so there is no need to send
me anything at all, except perhaps those small 7d. editions
of novels.</p></div>

<p>An English lady wrote early in 1915 from Munich:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I must tell you I had permission to visit a wounded
English officer, a cousin, and I think it would reassure many
people at home to know how warmly he speaks of the great
kindness that has been shown him now for five months, as
well as the skill and attention of the doctors.&mdash;(<i>Times</i>,
March 17, 1915.)</p></div>

<p>Here, too, is a letter from Lieut.-Observer J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;P.
Harvey, an officer of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry, and
attached to the Royal Flying Corps:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I met one of the pilots of the German machines that
had attacked us. He could speak English well and we shook
hands after a most thrilling fight. I had brought down his
machine with my machine-gun, and he had to land quite
close to where I landed. He had a bullet through his
radiator and petrol tank, but neither he nor his observer
was touched. I met two German officers that knew several
people that I knew, and they were most awfully kind to me.
They gave me a very good dinner of champagne and oysters,
etc., and I was treated like an honoured guest. I then came
by train the next day to Mainz, where I was confined in a
room by myself for two days. I have now been moved into
a general room with eight other English officers, where we
sleep and eat. We are treated very well, and play hockey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>and tennis in the prison yard.&mdash;(<i>News of the World</i>,
February 27, 1916.)</p></div>

<p>Miss Colenso gives the following account, which
appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> of June 28, 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A minister friend of mine told me the story of a young
Scottish boy of his acquaintance, now a military prisoner in
Germany&mdash;I forget for the moment in which camp. This
boy received a letter from home one day telling of his
mother&#8217;s serious illness and the doctor&#8217;s verdict that she
could only live a few weeks. The German Commandant,
finding the boy in great distress, asked him what was the
matter, and on learning the cause of his grief, said: &#8220;Would
you like to go home to your mother?&#8221; The boy sprang up,
exclaiming indignantly, &#8220;How can you mock me when you
know it is impossible?&#8221; &#8220;But you shall go, my boy,&#8221; said
the commandant. &#8220;I will pay your return fare on condition
that you give me your word of honour to come back here.&#8221;
The boy went home to Scotland and remained by his mother&#8217;s
side for about three weeks till her death, when, true to his
word, he returned to Germany.</p></div>

<p>The writer of &#8220;Under the Clock&#8221; considers that
&#8220;well-attested&#8221; stories of this kind should be given
publicity. It is even more necessary to examine the
&#8220;attestation&#8221; of the other kinds of stories, for all the
bias is against the enemy, and demand is apt to create
supply.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Merseburg, D&#339;beritz.</span></h3>

<p>I pass on now to a report made by a United States
Official. The American Consul writes from Leipzig
under date of November 16, 1914: &#8220;On Saturday
afternoon, the 14th instant, I visited the military
concentration camp near Merseburg, where some
10,000 prisoners of war are interned. The object of
my visit was to investigate the claim of a French
prisoner that he is an American subject. The result
of my observations regarding the welfare and humane
treatment of the prisoners at large was a surprise to
me.... Separated by nationality, these prisoners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>are housed in wooden buildings, well built, ventilated
and heated.... They sleep upon straw mattresses
in well-warmed quarters, and, as far as I could judge,
are as well or better housed than labourers upon public
works in the United States. The prisoners are fed
three times a day. Breakfast consists of coffee and
bread. Dinner consists of vegetable and meat, soup
and bread, and for supper they are given bread and
coffee. I was informed that many of the prisoners
have some money, and that they are allowed to buy
whatever else they may wish to eat. If I may judge
from the mounds of empty beer bottles at hand, there
is evidence in support of this statement. The
prisoners appeared to be in good health and cheerful,
many of them engaging in games and other
pastimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The diet described must be frightfully monotonous.
Feeding has throughout been one of the German
difficulties. &#8220;Germany claims to hold 433,000
prisoners of war,&#8221; wrote an anonymous American
journalist (probably in November, 1914); &#8220;the housing
and feeding of so great a number must be a
tremendous strain upon resources drained by the
necessities of war.&#8221; The numbers must now exceed
two million. The Press article referred to [Misc.
No. 7 (1915)] is severe on the misery of camp life,
and the verminousness of the men (they were of
mixed nationality) in the camp at D&ouml;beritz which he
visited. (See, however, the further official reports
quoted below at p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_9">9</a>). But the writer does not
confine his condemnation to one side. &#8220;One hears of
battles in which no quarter is granted. There are
stories of one side or the other refusing an armistice
to permit the other to gather its wounded. Each
side is desperately determined to win, and neither is
counting the cost. So men must rust in prison
camps until the struggle is over.&#8221; The monotony in
this case seems to have been varied by fights between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>the prisoners of different nationality, each set considering
that the others had not done their part in the war.
We need not be contemptuous about that. The
monotony of the prisoners&#8217; life must tend to produce
the maximum degree of mutual friction. There is
absolutely no privacy for the prisoner of war. To be
forced to remain, day and night, for months and years
in idleness, with a crowd of others, not of one&#8217;s own
choice is, I believe, one of the psychological factors
which make internment (especially to many civilians)
decidedly worse than imprisonment in a criminal
prison.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Correspondence and Packages.</span></h3>

<p>My next document illustrates the fact that each
side makes similar complaints about the other.
Telegram received by American Embassy, London,
December 23, 1914, 22nd from Berlin Embassy:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;Foreign Office reports receiving many complaints that
money and packages sent German military and civilian
prisoners in enemy countries from Germany do not reach
addresses. Please secure information for Department to
forward German Foreign Office whether money and other
postal matter will be delivered to such prisoners promptly
and intact.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bryan</span>, Washington.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that many letters and parcels have
<i>not</i> reached German prisoners in England. Lord
Robert Cecil has fully allowed this. (<i>Times</i> report.
March 11, 1915.) In spite of this, I have no doubt
that the British authorities have done their best to
expedite delivery. I would suggest that this is
probably the case on the other side, too. We shall
indeed later come upon some definite statements in
support of this view. One frequent cause of the non-arrival
of parcels in Germany has been convincingly
described by Mr. Ian Malcolm, M.P. (<i>Daily Mail</i>,
November 8, 1916, and Reprint):</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>I did not approach this subject quite &#8220;new to the game.&#8221;
I had already visited general post offices in England, Switzerland
and elsewhere, and had seen thousands, literally
thousands, of food parcels intended for our prisoners of war
in Germany falling to bits and incapable of being forwarded
for want of skilled packing. The sight was enough to make
angels weep. To think that so much self-sacrifice had been
exercised in humble homes to save up bits of dripping, crusts
of bread, broken cigarettes, and what not, in order that
these should reach son or brother or sweetheart in Germany,
yet packed so badly albeit by loving hands, that in the first
rough and tumble of the post the paper burst, the string
came undone, and the contents of a dozen parcels fell in an
inextricable jumble upon the floor.</p></div>

<p>There will unfortunately, too, be those in every
land who will take opportunities for mean thefts. We
have all had experience of that during this war, and
the following cutting from the <i>Daily News</i> of October
5, 1915, may be given in illustration:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>In a letter of thanks to the secretary of the committee
of the Elswick and Scotswood workmen, formed for the
purpose of sending comforts to the troops, Sir Ian Hamilton
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p>I am extremely touched by the extraordinary generosity
and kindness of the Elswick and Scotswood workmen. I
will take great care to let our soldiers know to whom they are
indebted for this most handsome contribution. Pray
heaven the parcels will escape thieves and scoundrels who
waylaid some of the gifts, and will arrive in good condition.</p>
</div></div>

<p>If there are, alas, not a few men who will steal from
their comrades, there are not likely to be fewer who
will steal from their enemies.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, however, the delivery of
parcels on both sides soon became commendably
regular. The care shown on the German side is
warmly praised by Captain Gilbert Nobbs, who
remained quite able to appreciate good deeds even
after enduring terrible hardships and hearing worse
stories from others. The bad deeds of war, soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>are able to judge better than civilians. In his book
&#8220;Englishman, Kamerad,&#8221; Captain Nobbs writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I was very much impressed with the fair and systematic
handling of our parcels, letters and money; even letters and
postcards which arrived for me after I had been sent back
to England, were re-addressed and sent back. A remittance
of five pounds which arrived for me after I had
left was even returned to me in England, instead of being
applied to the pressing need of the German War Loan.&mdash;(<i>Daily
News</i>, January 25, 1918.)</p></div>

<p>An acquaintance of my own, a lecturer in a technical
school, spoke to me to the same effect. He told me,
as an illustration, of a parcel sent to him which had
become quite shattered in transit (p.p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_7">7</a>). The
Germans transferred the contents to a sack, and, as
he said, the temptation to pilfer the sorely-needed
foodstuffs must have been great. My informant also
spoke of the very thorough inoculation against
disease.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Altdamm.</span></h3>

<p>On December 31, 1914, Mr. Damm reported to Mr.
Gerard on the Camp at Altdamm near Stettin. The
general arrangement, he remarks, is the same as that
of the camp at Stargard on which he had reported
previously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears to me that every effort is being made
to treat the prisoners of war as humanely as possible
in the two camps I visited. Dry and warm shelter
is provided, the food is simple and perhaps
monotonous, but of good material and well prepared,
sanitary arrangements are good, and the health of the
men is carefully looked after.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rumours v. Inspection.</span></h3>

<p>But the general inspection of all camps had not yet
been agreed to by the German Government, and on
February 23, 1915, Sir Edward Grey wrote to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Page (the American Ambassador in London) complaining
that no definite replies to his questions were
forthcoming. &#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s Government,&#8221; he
continues, &#8220;have only unofficial information and
rumours on the subject to guide them, which they
trust do not accurately represent the facts.&#8221; The
&#8220;unofficial information and rumours&#8221; had, however,
attained wide publicity, and obtained still more later.</p>

<p>The German authorities agreed on March 17, 1915,
to general inspection of detention camps and consideration
of complaints. The reports now to be cited
were made after this date. [Misc. 11 (1915)]. I
propose to give examples of almost all the earlier
reports, for it was in the earlier stages of the war that
there was most difficulty everywhere in providing
accommodation for prisoners. We ought not to forget
that the earliest reports on our own camps which the
British Government have published begin with
February, 1916.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">D&#339;beritz.</span></h3>

<p>On March 31 Mr. Jackson reported on the camp at
D&ouml;beritz, a large camp with between three and four
thousand British prisoners. &#8220;So far as I could
ascertain, British soldiers are called upon to do only
their share in fatigue work.... So far as I could
ascertain, after inquiry of a number of men, nothing
was known as to the stopping of either incoming or
outgoing correspondence.... The camp at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>D&ouml;beritz is in a healthy location, and the barracks
are new and of a permanent character.... They
are at least as good as those used by the Germans
at present in the same neighbourhood. As was to be
expected a number of men had individual grievances,
but there were no general complaints, except with
regard to the German character of the food&mdash;<i>and those
were the exact counterparts of complaints made to me
by German prisoners in England</i>.&#8221; I have italicised
the last clause as it will surely, to a fair-minded man,
seem a somewhat important one.</p>

<p>Mr. Lithgow Osborne visited the camp at the same
time. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Until two weeks ago the Russians and English were, in
cases, housed together&mdash;a source of complaint to the latter,
more especially on account of vermin. The races have now
been separated. The men all stated that they had the two
blankets and the other requisites provided in the German
rules, and I heard but one complaint about overcrowding.
Most of the English and French receive clothes from home.
All the prisoners who do not, are furnished from the camp
supply; the men stated that this was carried out according
to the rules.</p>

<p>No complaints whatever were made regarding the Commandant,
the non-commissioned officers, or the general
government of the camp. The food was the source of the
few real complaints that could be heard, although at least
half of the men spoken to admitted that it was quite as good
as could possibly be expected.</p>

<p>The impression of the whole was excellent, and one received
the idea that everything that could reasonably be expected
was done for the men by the authorities in charge.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Three Poor Camps.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Jackson&#8217;s reports on Burg bei Magdeburg,
Magdeburg and Halle a/d Saale are the most
unfavourable. They were all small officers&#8217; camps,
Burg containing 75, Magdeburg 30, Halle 50 British
officers. There were a few orderlies at each camp.</p>

<p>The chief points are inadequate ventilation,
inadequate service for officers and, in the first two,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>the fact that living rooms were used for all purposes,
there being no special mess or recreation rooms.
There seemed, however, to be no discrimination
against the British.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">G&#339;ttingen.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Page himself reports on G&ouml;ttingen, where there
were about 6,000 prisoners. &#8220;The Camp Commandant,
Colonel Bogen, has done everything possible to make
this a model camp, and he has accomplished a great
work. The only complaint is as to the food, the
quantity of which, of course, is not under the control
of the Commandant, as he is limited to an expenditure
of only 60 pfennigs (about 7d.) per day per man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything was in the most beautiful order. There
was a very fine steam laundry and drying room, bath
rooms, with hot and cold showers, and the closets,
etc., are in a very good condition and scientifically
built. There is running water and electricity in the
camp. A French barrister of Arras, named L&eacute;on
Paillet, who was working with the French Red Cross
and who, for some reason or other, has been made a
prisoner, has done marvellous work in organising
libraries, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am pleased to say that the professors and pastors
in G&ouml;ttingen have, from the first, taken an interest in
this camp, and Professor Stange has done much in
helping the lot of the prisoners. The Y.M.C.A.
building, erected through the efforts of Mr. A.&nbsp;C.
Harte, who for a number of years has been working
with the Y.M.C.A. in India, will be a great help to
the men in the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the opening ceremonies there were speeches by
Colonel Bogen, Mr. Harte, and Professor Stange, and
then each speech was delivered in English and French
by prisoners. These were followed by short speeches
by French, English, and Belgian prisoners. Then
came a concert by the camp orchestra and the camp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>singing society, followed by songs and recitations by
various prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Ohnesorg reported further on April 22. At that
time there were 6,577 prisoners, of whom 1,586 were
British. He warmly commends the steam laundry,
the steam disinfecting plant, and the hospital. &#8220;A
spirit of contentment pervaded the camp. The
British prisoners were well clothed. I tasted the
evening meal, consisting of a vegetable soup, which
was very palatable and, I should say, nourishing....
The citizens of G&ouml;ttingen have taken a
great interest in the camp, and some of them, notably
Professor Stange, of the University, have given a great
deal of their time to the welfare of prisoners and the
formation of classes for study amongst them.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Help for Prisoners.</span></h3>

<p>The interest taken by prominent Germans in the
welfare of prisoners of war is little recognised in this
country. The Berlin Committee (of which more will
be said later) has received considerable support. At
the end of June, 1916, a meeting in support of its
work was held at the house of Prince Lichnowsky,
former Ambassador in London, who returned specially
from the front to preside. The Bishop of Winchester,
writing in the <i>Times</i>, tells us that many notable men
and women were present, and that at the meeting a
collection of 8,000 marks (about &pound;400) was made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cologne.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Michelson visited in April, 1915, the three
Cologne hospitals in which wounded British prisoners
are lying. He reports as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>These institutions are so typical of large, modern, well
ordered hospitals that little need be said of their employment
or management. They are provided with all the machinery
and paraphernalia usual to surgical work on a large scale,
contain all standard and necessary conveniences and fittings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>afford to patients a maximum of protection in the matter
of sanitation, quiet and relief from preventable irritation,
and are conducted in a thoroughly scientific, professional and
humane way.</p>

<p>The names of the 49 wounded British prisoners are hereunto
annexed. I personally spoke to every one of these
men, and with many of them I conversed privately and
without being overheard. With but one exception no English-speaking
British prisoner had any complaint to make, and a
number of the British prisoners eagerly expressed to me their
appreciation for the care and attention given them.</p>

<p>The physical condition of the Indians is particularly good.
Only 21 deaths have occurred among the 1,000 wounded
cared for in hospital No. VI. since the war began, and the
death rate in the other two hospitals is correspondingly low.
The physicians in charge consider the rate to be somewhat
remarkable in view of the many grave injuries treated.</p>

<p>In closing I may say that there is no discrimination or
segregation among the patients and that certain French
patients with whom I spoke expressed, likewise, their
appreciation for the care and attention given them.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crefeld.</span></h3>

<p>At Crefeld Mr. Michelson visited the camp for
interned officers. Of these interned 137 were British.
The general statements of the Commandant &#8220;were
afterwards independently confirmed by the one
interned British medical officer, Captain Benjamin
Johnson, who said that as a physician he had no complaints
to make or improvements to suggest. He did,
however, complain on the score of being held prisoner,
but the Commandant and the German medical officer,
and I with them, feel that the presence of a British
medical officer in the barracks is desirable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bath room which I saw has a floor space of
about 1,500 square feet, one-half of which, drained in
the centre, lies under some 20 shower nozzles. There
are a couple of porcelain tubs in the other half, and
in the centre there is a large stove. Hot and cold
water is available. The British officers were
enthusiastic in their praise of this room.</p>

<p>&#8220;As regards the sleeping rooms, wash rooms and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>latrines, and their equipment, the general German
housing regulations are being fully complied with. I
visited a great many sleeping rooms, and in none of
them did I find overcrowding, uncleanliness,
insufficient light, heat, or equipment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The orderlies are housed in stalls in one of the
stables, and in their regard, too, the general German
housing regulations are being fully complied with.
Their quarters looked sufficiently comfortable and
clean, and two or three of the orderlies with whom I
spoke said that they had no complaints to make, and
that they were happy to be interned with, and not
apart from their officers. I visited the one building
fenced off from the others&mdash;also a stable&mdash;in which
German soldiers are quartered, and I found the
accommodation and equipment there to be precisely
that furnished to the orderlies. The comparison was,
however, somewhat in favour of the orderlies, for the
orderlies were fewer in number and less crowded than
the soldiers. Although exercise is not compulsory,
there is ample space in the central rectangle for out-door
games of all sorts and for walking. No appropriate
form of exercise, recreation, or amusement is
denied the interned, and opportunities for distraction
within the barracks lie largely in their own hands.
Smoking is freely permitted, and English, French and
Russian songs are sung without interference. The
walls of one French officer&#8217;s room were covered with
good-natured caricature drawings. When I asked the
Commandant if the interned might not be permitted to
go out into the country under guard, he replied that
the barracks were too near the frontier for that, and he
mentioned that one officer had already escaped and
succeeded in getting over the border.&#8221;</p>

<p>Food is provided to all officers at the rate of two
marks daily. This absorbs the whole of a lieutenant&#8217;s
pay, and the Commandant recognised the difficulty.
But &#8220;none of the officers want the present arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>altered if alteration is to involve a decrease in
the quality, quantity, or variety of the food furnished.
All of them agree that the food is entirely satisfactory,
under the circumstances, and that it is fully worth
two marks a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;The officers told me that letters and packages
were delivered to them with commendable rapidity,
and that the Commandant was unfailingly obliging
when, for important reasons, any officer needed to
send off more than two letters a month.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gardelegen, Salzwedel.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Ohnesorg, of the U.S. Navy, inspected
Gardelegen and Salzwedel. Owing to typhus, the
former was not completely inspected. Two hundred
and twenty-eight British soldiers were interned here.
Dr. Ohnesorg remarks that the situation is open,
with natural drainage. There was a good and
unstinted water supply. &#8220;I had a long talk alone
with Captain Brown. He spoke well of the camp.&#8221;
&#8220;Work was being rushed on&#8221; for the complete
eradication of the clothing louse which is the carrier
of the infection. &#8220;It should be mentioned that the
Russian prisoners, who are primarily responsible for
the introduction of the disease, are quartered alone,
... but all the prisoners associate with one another
in the compound.&#8221; At Salzwedel, out of a total of
7,900 prisoners, only 49 were British. The supply of
water was unstinted. Shower baths and hot water
were available. Each man could have a bath every
three days, and the baths were being added to. In
the hospital &#8220;the English doctor informed me that
the medicines and treatment accorded to the sick were
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The majority of the English prisoners complained
of not getting enough food and the monotony of the
diet. The black bread was another point of protest.
I myself was given a sample of the mid-day meal as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>came from the kettle. It consisted of a thick soup
containing potatoes, beans, and small portions of fish.
It was palatable, and I should say nourishing. The
prisoners do not do heavy work, their work being
police duties, etc. I must add that those whom I saw
were well nourished, of good colour, and appeared to
be in good physical condition. There were only a
half-dozen on the sick list, and, with one exception,
they were under treatment for wounds.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Guestrow, Muenster (Lager), Soltau, Scheuen,
Schloss Celle.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Jackson reported on the first four of these. The
G&uuml;strow camp (Mecklenburg) contained about 6,000
prisoners, of whom 300 were British. It is situated in
the pine woods, and consists of &#8220;solid, newly-built
wooden barracks, lighted by electricity and heated.&#8221;
Washing and bathing facilities were good and the
postal department well organised. &#8220;Clothing is
furnished when required, <i>if asked for</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several workrooms, and most of the men
who have trades can find something to do to occupy
their time and can earn a little money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the British soldiers spoke of harsh treatment
immediately following their capture&mdash;at the
beginning of the war&mdash;and while they were being
transported to Germany, and several spoke of their
having been handled roughly while in the tents.
Others said frankly that most of those who had been
treated badly since they came to the camp had done
something to deserve it. In any event all admitted
that their present treatment was good, and that there
was now no discrimination against the British.
British soldiers had never been called on to do more
than their share of the dirty work about the camp. A
party of Russians had always had charge of the
latrines, voluntarily, in return for some small compensation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>The spirits of the British prisoners seemed
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The account of M&uuml;nster is almost precisely similar&mdash;&#8220;solidly-built
barracks,&#8221; &#8220;good bathing arrangements,&#8221;
&#8220;well-arranged hospital.&#8221; Suggestive of
the nervous strain of internment is the following:
&#8220;Here the relations between the British and
Belgians seemed cordial, and the former participated
in the recent celebration of King Albert&#8217;s birthday,
which the French declined to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Soltau there were about 30,000 prisoners,
principally Belgian. Four hundred were British.
German control was largely eliminated, but the
results in this case do not seem to have been satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this camp there seemed to be fewer German
soldiers on duty than is the rule elsewhere, and
practically the whole of its administration is in the
hands of the Belgians, who have organised many
courses of study (under Belgian professors) and who
have a Catholic Church, a theatre, an orchestra, and
a choir. The British complained that there is discrimination
against them here (apparently more by
the Belgians than by the Germans), and that they
are not permitted to participate in the administration
or to be represented in the kitchen or post office.
Complaints were made about the food and the delivery
of mail and parcels, and it was said that the Belgians
objected to have them join in football games, etc.
They also said that they were compelled to do much
more than their share of fatigue work in connection
with the latrines. All these complaints were brought
to the attention of the officer in charge, who promised
to investigate them, as apparently but little attention
had been paid to such matters so long as there had
been no trouble in the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Scheuen near Celle a similar difficulty existed.
There were 118 British out of a total of 9,000 prisoners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;The British non-commissioned officers muster their
men and exercise some general control over them,
but the French or Belgian non-commissioned officers
are in charge of the barracks and designate the men
who are to do fatigue duty. In consequence, it is
claimed, British soldiers are detailed to such work
more frequently than those of other nationalities. On
speaking of this to the Commandant, he promised at
once to arrange so that a more fair division of work
should be made in the future. Otherwise the men
made no complaint with regard to any discrimination
against them.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Zueder Zollhaus, Wahn.</span></h3>

<p>The reports issued in Miscellaneous, No. 14 (1915)
continue the inspections and reinspections up to the
middle of May. As improvements were continuously
being made in the camps, it is scarcely necessary to
refer in detail to these further reports. There are
reports on fifteen camps for military prisoners. Two
of these reports (those on the &#8220;working camp&#8221; at
Z&uuml;der Zollhaus and Wahn) are unfavourable, thirteen
are favourable. At Z&uuml;der Zollhaus were 2,000
prisoners, of whom 479 were British. The camp was
for prisoners who were willing to work on the land.
&#8220;I was given to understand,&#8221; writes Dr. Ohnesorg,
&#8220;that this camp would only be occupied during the
summer months.&#8221; The inspector finds the hospital
accommodation in this case &#8220;very crude.&#8221; There
were about thirty cases of sickness which should
certainly have been removed elsewhere. The morning
meal seems very small for the morning&#8217;s work. It
consists of either soup or coffee with 300 grammes
(say 10 oz.) of bread. Altogether it is plain that
improvements here were urgently needed. Dr.
Ohnesorg, however, says: &#8220;All of them (the British
prisoners) appeared to be in good physical condition....
The work is not hard, and they are permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>to take it leisurely.... They informed me that
their treatment was good, they were not overworked,
and practically the only complaint they had to make
was that a more substantial meal to begin the day on
should be given them.&#8221; At Wahn the food was complained
of, and the most unpleasant feature is that
the Commandant did not seem on good terms with
the British.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blankenburg.</span></h3>

<p>As regards the camp for officers at Blankenburg,
Mr. Jackson writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The house itself is as comfortable as any of the places
where I saw interned officers in England.... It is
surrounded by attractive, well-kept grounds, in which a
tennis-court has just been made.... There are several
modestly furnished mess and recreation rooms, and a terrace
which is used for afternoon tea.... The Commandant
is interested in his work, and evidently does all he can to
make conditions agreeable.</p></div>

<p>There were 110 officers, of whom nine were British.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Senne.</span></h3>

<p>At Sennelager Mr. Osborne reports:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The situation of the camp is good ... on very dry,
sandy soil, surrounded at a few kilometres by pine forests.
The buildings are good. Though there were the customary
complaints about the food, more than half the men I spoke
with expressed themselves as satisfied.... The men looked
healthy, and they all stated that the general health of the
camp was excellent.... There are shower baths with hot
and cold water.... The men said they were well treated
by the Commandants and the German soldiers and N.C.O.&#8217;s
in charge of them.</p></div>

<p>The camps at Sennelager are large ones, and include
more than two thousand British prisoners. Games,
concerts, and theatrical performances help to pass the
time. A play given by French prisoners was entitled:
<i>Avant et apr&egrave;s la guerre.</i></p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mainz.</span></h3>

<p>Of the officers&#8217; camp at Mainz, Dr. Ohnesorg
reports that &#8220;The quality and quantity of the food
was good and varied.... One and all the British
officers spoke in the highest terms of their commanding
officer, his kindness and courtesy, and said that
they received every privilege which could be afforded
them, considering their position.&#8221; There were
about 700 officers, of whom 25 were British. &#8220;If
anything,&#8221; says the American Consul at Wiesbaden
in a later report on Mainz, &#8220;I should think the
British officers would ... receive almost greater
courtesy at the hands of their keepers than those of
the other nations.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks of Dr. Ohnesorg.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Ohnesorg appends some general remarks on the
camps he visited. In the following quotations I have
omitted nothing which is in the nature of adverse
criticism:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole the treatment accorded them is
good, but frequent protests were made to me concerning
the food&mdash;not so much because of its quality, as
because of the insufficient quantity and the monotony
of the diet. The prisoners, however, appeared to be
in good physical condition and well nourished.
Appended are various weekly dietary slips. I had an
opportunity in various camps to sample either the
mid-day or the evening meal. I found them palatable
and, I should say, nourishing. Considering the fact
that the men have practically no hard work to do, it
appears to be sufficient in quantity, each man getting
a liberal allowance&mdash;probably a litre and a half of
food per meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The treatment accorded the sick and wounded
prisoners is excellent. They are given every
advantage of medicines and treatment, and special
food when necessary. A dietary slip of the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>is appended. The same routine, the same food, etc.,
as in use in German military hospitals, apply for these
various hospitals in prison camps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found no discrimination made between prisoners
of various nationalities. With the exception of
Limburg, the British prisoners are housed with the
Russians, French and Belgians, and this is the cause
oft-times of complaint on the part of the English,
especially if they are under the direct supervision of a
non-commissioned officer of another nationality. Some
of them stated that the work, i.e., the police duties,
etc., largely because of this are not equally and justly
divided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every precaution is taken by the authorities
against the spread of disease in camp. All the
prisoners are vaccinated against smallpox, and are
immunised against typhoid and cholera. Certain
simple rules against the contraction of disease are
posted throughout the camps, and the men are
impressed with the importance of personal cleanliness.
Baths are obligatory, the facilities affording each man
a weekly bath under the showers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water supply in the camps is good. In most
of them it is connected with the city supply, and
when not, Artesian wells have been sunk on the
premises and water thus obtained. Taps are placed
throughout the company streets, and the use of water
is unstinted.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule, the prisoners were found to be well
clothed, although not all in their own uniforms.
Some were in French uniforms, and some in a combination
of Russian, French, and British.</p>

<p>&#8220;In many of these camps, prisoners are loaned out
throughout the country to work upon farms, and, in
some cases, in various industries. This is entirely
voluntary on the part of the prisoner, and this service
is mostly accepted by the French. No British
volunteer. These men have a guard over them, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>housed and fed by their employer and receive five
pfennigs a day in pay. It breaks the monotony of
prison life, and many more volunteer than are needed
for this work.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Regulations.</span></h3>

<p>On April 24, 1915, the Prussian Ministry of War
issued a new set of regulations respecting the maintenance
of prisoners of war. They show great
thoroughness and forethought, but I am afraid the
average Englishman would be as unready to believe
that they showed genuine good intentions, as the
average German would be to believe that favourable
regulations issued by the English authorities were
really <i>bona fide</i>. Yet, as it seems to me of general
interest, I will here give the second regulation:
&#8220;Self-management as regards catering has already
been ordered for military and civilian prisoners&#8217;
camps, as this system has been proved far preferable
to the employment of contractors. Nearly all the
complaints about the food come from camps where
contractors are employed.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Erfurt, Ohrdruf.</span></h3>

<p>It is impossible to do more than make very brief
citations from the remaining reports. In no case is
the report otherwise than favourable, and the food is
described as good.</p>

<p>At Erfurt &#8220;the kitchens are clean, and the midday
soup (which I tasted) was good&#8221;. The British soldiers
had no complaint against German officers or soldiers,
but &#8220;they claimed that the French or Belgian non-commissioned
officers caused them to be detailed as
members of working parties more frequently than their
fellow prisoners of other nationalities.&#8221; This reminds
us that complaints arise in institutions other than those
worked by &#8220;enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Ohrdruf &#8220;a number of men who had been treated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>for their wounds in the lazaret at Weimar spoke in the
highest praise of their treatment by German doctors
and nurses.... Some of the British thought (as at
Erfurt) that they were detailed to working parties (by
French non-commissioned officers) more frequently
than the others, but otherwise no complaint was made
to me of any discrimination against them.&#8221; The
British did not like the soup, &#8220;but almost without
exception they seemed in good physical condition and
in good spirits.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Gerard&#8217;s Comments.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;The food question,&#8221; writes Mr. Gerard (U.S.
Ambassador at Berlin), &#8220;is of course a difficult one
in a country where the whole population is put upon
a bread ration. Most of the rumours current in
England are without foundation or very exaggerated....
No British prisoner needs clothes in Germany ... and
I have just learned that British prisoners at
Zossen, to whom we sent clothes, shoes, etc., have
sold these articles to the French prisoners and are
asking for a second supply.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Muenden, Friedberg, Torgau, Merseberg.</span></h3>

<p>Thirteen British prisoners at Hannover-M&uuml;nden
&#8220;said that they were not discriminated against in any
way.... All seemed in good spirits.&#8221; At Friedberg
were 13 British officers. &#8220;The commandant drew my
particular attention to the row of little gardens cared
for by the interned, and is much pleased with this
feature of the place. He also told me he would like to
allow officers to have dogs, but he fears this cannot
be done.... The officers&#8217; rooms amply exceed all
requirements as to housing and equipment.... The
dining-rooms are two ... and either room would do
credit to a club or hotel of the first class.&#8221; At Torgau
&#8220;the commandant spoke of the British officers to me
in very complimentary terms.&#8221; At Merseberg &#8220;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>new food regulations are in force.... No complaints
were made to me about the food, and the men appeared
to be in good health.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Penny Blue Book.</span></h3>

<p>On May 14, 1915, Viscount (then Sir Edward) Grey,
writing to Mr. Page (U.S. Ambassador in London),
mentioned that His Majesty&#8217;s Government &#8220;have
heard with pleasure that there is a distinct disposition
on the part of the German authorities to accept
suggestions made for the welfare of the prisoners of
war.&#8221; These words gave hope of the development of
better feeling and of those &#8220;reprisals of good&#8221;
which many believe to be more constructive than
reprisals of frightfulness. The Penny Blue Book on
the treatment of prisoners of war, issued not long after
this, was not helpful to these hopes. As regards
Germany, this publication consists almost exclusively
of the &#8220;unofficial information and rumours&#8221; which,
as Sir Edward Grey stated in February, 1915, His
Majesty&#8217;s Government &#8220;trusted did not accurately
represent the facts.&#8221; The result is unfortunate. The
Blue Book is limited by its title to &#8220;the first eight
months of the war,&#8221; and deals almost exclusively with
charges brought before the close of 1914, when, as is
well known, there was confusion everywhere. The
method of arranging the evidence is too much that of
an advocate aiming at producing the maximum effect.
For example, we read (page 6): &#8220;The United States
Consul-General at Berlin heard on October 16 that
information regarding the treatment of non-commissioned
officers and men of the British Army who are
prisoners of war in other camps is anxiously awaited
at Torgau. &#8216;Rumours of their exposure to the
elements, their starvation and their treatment, are
rampant all along the line.&#8217;&#8221; On turning to Misc. 7
(1915) we find that <i>these last words were not those of
the American Consul-General</i>, but those of an officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>interned at Torgau. The American Ambassador, Mr.
Gerard, writes: &#8220;It should also be added that,
although the British officers at Torgau state that they
have heard reports of starvation and ill-treatment of
British soldiers in other prisoners&#8217; camps, the
Embassy have no reason for believing that this is the
case.&#8221; <i>This statement is omitted in the Penny Blue
Book.</i></p>

<p>To give the public an idea of the camp at D&ouml;beritz
quotations are made (page 33) from an article by an
anonymous American journalist. An early official
report is cited which gives a very different impression,
but as it is quoted in quite a different part (page 18)
of the Blue Book, the contradiction is only seen on
careful examination. On the covers of the two copies
of the Blue Book which I have are lists of Foreign
Office publications. Amongst these (see pages 9, 10)
is Miscel. No. 11 (1915) (price 3d.), which contains
two official U.S. reports on D&ouml;beritz, one by Mr.
Jackson, the other by Mr. Lithgow Osborne, both of
them entirely favourable. No hint of the existence of
these reports (received on April 10 and April 24
respectively) is given in the body of the Penny Blue
Book. As regards British camps, the only evidence
cited is the report made by Mr. Chandler Hale of the
U.S. Embassy after the riot at Douglas in November,
1914.</p>

<p>I am fully aware that the sufferings of prisoners of
war, as of soldiers in the field, cannot be adequately
presented in official reports, but the sifting of more
human and biased evidence is an extremely difficult
task, and it is sufficiently plain that we should not
rely on official evidence to exculpate ourselves, while
using rumours and unofficial information to condemn
the enemy.</p>

<p>There are very many prison camps in Germany,
and their individual tone must depend enormously
upon the aims and efforts of the commandant in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>charge. A mistake of appointment, almost a slip of
the pen, and a man may be in charge who will make
life unendurable as only unlimited authority can.</p>

<p>The words used by Lord Newton in the House of
Lords on July 31, 1917, are noteworthy in this
connection. One impression he derived from his
intercourse with the German delegates at the Hague
was that &#8220;in spite of the German power of centralisation,
Berlin headquarters did not know a great deal of
what was going on. As the Germans had thirty times
as many prisoners as we had, it would be surprising if
they did know what went on.&#8221; (<i>Daily News</i>, August
1, 1917.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Prisoner in Austria.</span></h3>

<p>Here is an account of a British member of Parliament,
a prisoner in Austria:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Captain A. Stanley Wilson, M.P., who is a prisoner of
war in Austria, has written the following letter to Colonel
Duncombe, chairman of the Holderness Conservative Association,
here:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p>&#8220;I am a prisoner of war, and with only one hope&mdash;that
the war will be over soon. I was taken off a Greek
steamer by a submarine on December 6. After two nights
and a day on board I was brought here. I must not give
any details. Colonel Napier was also taken prisoner, and
we are together. Fortunately I have in him a capital
companion who can speak German very well.</p>

<p>I am afraid it will be a very long time before I see
my constituents. I wish them all a happy new year and
hope that during next year I may meet them again. The
outlook for me is not very bright, but I intend to do my
best to be cheerful. Up to the present we have been very
well treated. We had some most exciting experiences in
the submarine. The officers on board treated us as though
we were their guests and not their prisoners. We have as
companions two French officers who were made prisoners
the day before us, their submarine having run ashore.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian</i>, January 10, 1916.</p></div>

<p>Captain Wilson (an able-bodied prisoner) has since
been unconditionally released.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><span class="smcap">The Food Question.</span></h3>

<p>The report already given makes it clear that very
similar complaints, or (as Mr. Jackson puts it
[page 16]) complaints that were &#8220;exact counterparts&#8221;
as to food, have often been made on both
sides. It is also plain that complaints on this score
in German camps have been by no means universal.
I do not in the least suppose that the food in general
would be satisfying or other than dreadfully
monotonous. (&#8220;Oft recht eint&ouml;nig,&#8221; says Professor
Stange quite frankly in his interesting pamphlet on
G&ouml;ttingen camp.) Loss of appetite, depression,
indigestion will then in many cases produce grave
physical trouble. All this may occur and does occur,
without anything like a deliberate attempt at starvation.
British born wives of interned Germans would
sometimes, even before the reduction of rations, speak
bitterly of their husbands&#8217; needs. An anti-English
journalist might have used such complaints to charge
us with starvation. But even perfectly <i>bona fide</i>
complaints need indicate only monotony, loss of
robustness, and consequent physical (and mental) ills&mdash;and
indeed the tragedy of these things may become
terribly dark. It is, however, something very different
from deliberate starvation.</p>

<p>In any comparison between the two sides it is only
fair to take into account the special difficulties of the
German case. The number of prisoners in Germany
by August, 1915, was probably over one million. This
is an enormous figure. While Great Britain and her
Allies have tried to prevent food from reaching
Germany, the drain upon the German food stock has
continually grown as the number of prisoners has
increased. By the end of 1917 this famished country
had to support probably more than two million extra
persons. The French Press long ago frankly regarded
this as one of the means of helping towards the
starving out of Germany, while in an American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>cartoon the Russian prisoners were figured as an
enormous beast with its head in a cupboard labelled
&#8220;Germany&#8217;s Food Supply.&#8221; These are considerations
for the fair-minded, and it is for them to recall that
as soon as there was in our own case a menace of food
shortage, there was also what might in official
language be described as a complete revision of the
prisoners&#8217; rations. The prisoners&#8217; own language
would very likely describe it differently. We can
scarcely be surprised at sad and even very bitter words
at times from prisoners&#8217; wives.</p>

<p>That prisoners themselves are, however, sometimes
able to envisage the difficulties is indicated by the
following extract from a <i>Daily News</i> interview with a
corporal repatriated from M&uuml;nster. He commented
on the fact that some men were the recipients of more
parcels than they needed, while others got none. The
interview continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>You see, without regular parcels from home a man
simply starves at a camp like M&uuml;nster. If the Germans had
the food I believe they would give it, but they haven&#8217;t:
they are starving themselves.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> All they allowed us was bread
and water and thin soup. The consequence is that the men
who get no parcels have to go round begging from the other
chaps just to keep body and soul together.</p>

<p>From what I saw of it, getting so much while others get
nothing isn&#8217;t good for a man either. Some fellows&mdash;the
stingy sort&mdash;will save up their parcels against a rainy day.
Make a regular little store they will. Others&mdash;the lively
sort&mdash;sell what they have over to the unlucky ones, and
spend their time gambling with the few marks they make.
Poor devils! You can&#8217;t blame them!</p></div>

<p>The word &#8220;starvation&#8221; has been, and is here, too
freely, if very naturally, used. The remarks of Lord
Newton, speaking in the House of Lords on May 31,
1916, are important in this connection:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>If Lord Beresford was accurate in his assumption that
prisoners of war would literally starve to death if parcels
did not arrive, hundreds of thousands of prisoners would
be dead already. Russian prisoners, of whom there were
over a million in Germany, received no parcels at all, and
if it was impossible to exist upon the food supplied by the
Germans, these men would literally have died like flies....
Lord Beresford and other noble lords had been rather
prone to ignore the fact that Germany was a blockaded
country. It was common knowledge that there was a general
scarcity of food throughout Germany, and, if the prisoners
did not get as much as they ought to have, in all probability
the vast majority of the German population was in a state
of comparative hunger.... He could not see what
advantage there was in making out that the case of our
prisoners was worse than it really was, and it seemed to him
little short of an act of cruelty to the relations of these unfortunate
men to lead them to suppose that our men were not
only in a state of misery, but in a state of starvation.&mdash;(<i>Morning
Post</i>, June 1, 1916).</p></div>

<p>There is no question either that nerve strain and
monotony accentuate the critical attitude towards
food. Here is an extract from Mr. Jackson&#8217;s report
on Senne (September 11, 1915): &#8220;There were some
complaints, as usual, in regard to the food. I had
arrived in the camp just after the midday meal was
served, and while some of the men said that the meat
had been bad, and they wished that I had an
opportunity to taste it, others said that the meat had
been particularly good, because the officers had heard
that I was coming. None of them knew that I had
actually eaten a plate of their soup and had found it
excellent, both palatable and nutritious, and that my
visit to this particular camp had not been announced
in advance. The menu for the day had been made out
at the beginning of the week, and could not have been
changed after my presence in the camp was known,
and I had a bowl of the soup which was left over after
the prisoners had been served.&#8221; (Miscel. 19 [1915],
page 41.)</p>

<p>It is sometimes forgotten that complaints as to food
are frequent in all institutions, schools, colleges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>workhouses, hospitals, etc. I have before me a recent
letter from an Englishman in a consumptive
sanatorium in his own country: &#8220;I exist as best I
can, and the less said about it the better. I am no
better, and only glad that I am not worse. I at least
don&#8217;t feel so ill as I did a week ago, although I have
lost 3&frac12; lbs. since then. The food is atrocious, and my
appetite small. The fellows here buy quite two-thirds
of what they eat, otherwise they too would lose in
weight. No good comes of making complaints ...
nothing is ever done.&#8221; Things <i>may</i> be so, I am not a
great believer in institutions, but certainly independent
investigation is needed to warrant any conclusion.
The same I feel to be the case as to complaints of
feeding, whether in British or German camps.</p>

<p>Each side, too, is also unreasonably certain of its
own justice and of the injustice of the others. Thus
the Social Democrat, Herr St&uuml;cklen, speaking in the
Reichstag debate of June 6, 1916, said: &#8220;I have
received a letter about the treatment of our prisoners
in France which says, &#8216;If pigs were so fed by us they
would go on hunger strike.&#8217; But I do not wish our
Government to exercise reprisals, which, after all,
could only hit the innocent.&#8221; [<i>Cambridge Magazine</i>,
August 26, 1916, Supplement &#8220;Prisoners.&#8221; An
important supplement for those who wish to get a
glimpse (it is no more than a glimpse) of recriminations
made by others as to treatment of prisoners.] It is
odd how exactly the same phrases occur on both sides.
Thus a private at D&ouml;beritz, according to the unknown
American journalist referred to on pages 5 and 25,
relieved his feelings as to the German food with the
words: &#8220;I &#8217;ad a sow. And even she wouldn&#8217;t eat
skilly.&#8221;</p>

<p>To suit the tastes of all the different nationalities
would at any time be difficult; under war conditions
it is impossible. Professor Stange relates how the
hostess of some Russian working prisoners thought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>give them a specially good meal of meat. The result,
however, was less bulky than a soup, and the Russian
comment on this occasion was, &#8220;Mother good, eating
not good.&#8221; (&#8220;Das Gefangenen-Lager in G&ouml;ttingen,&#8221;
page 9.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Prisoner&#8217;s Report.</span></h3>

<p>A serious and responsible statement of experiences
has been made by Chaplain Benjamin O&#8217;Rorke, M.A.,
in his little book, &#8220;In the Hands of the Enemy.&#8221; I
commend the book to the notice of those who wish
for a fair statement by a patriot who has actual
experience of a good many German camps in the early
days of the war. As he was taken prisoner in August,
1914, his experiences belong to the time before the
improvements introduced in all countries had been
begun. There are callous episodes, for instance, one of
revolting caddishness of an orderly standing by
without offering help when an invalid officer is
struggling to tie up his bootlace. Military bounce,
popular vulgarity, hardships, homesickness, courage&mdash;all
these things one may read of, but the incidents
which some journalists revel in are to seek. It was a
neutral journalist, we should remember, who sent to
a German paper a wonderful account of the panic fears
and regulations of London under the Zeppelin menace.</p>

<p>Chaplain O&#8217;Rorke&#8217;s reminiscences give us a good
many &#8220;facts towards fellowship.&#8221; Let us select a
few. Even the unpleasant ones may help us, where
they show that the failings of the others are the same
as our own. The prisoners were taken to Germany
from Landrecies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Credulity of Hate.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquote"><p>At Aachen a hostile demonstration took place at our
expense. There happened to be a German troop train in the
station at the time. A soldier of our escort displayed a
specimen of the British soldier&#8217;s knife, holding it up with
the marline-spike open, and declared that this was the deadly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>instrument which British medical officers had been using to
gouge out the eyes of the wounded Germans who had fallen
into their vindictive hands! From the knife he pointed to
the medical officers sitting placidly in the train, as much as
to say. &#8220;And these are some of the culprits.&#8221; [It is not
surprising that thus monstrously misinformed, and ready to
believe all evil against the hated English, the soldiers]
strained like bloodhounds on the leash. &#8220;Out with them!&#8221;
said their irate colonel, pointing with his thumb over his
shoulder to the carriages in which these blood-thirsty British
officers sat. The colonel, however, did not wait to see his
behest carried out, and a very gentlemanly German subaltern
quietly urged his men to get back to their train and leave us
alone. The only daggers that pierced us were the eyes of a
couple of priests, a few women and boys, who appeared to be
shocked beyond words that even a clergyman was amongst
such wicked men.</p></div>

<p>I have quoted this passage as I have not the least
wish to give a merely <i>couleur de rose</i> picture of the
situation. Human nature is, I fear, everywhere very
much the same, and, once its passions are aroused,
extremely credulous of evil against its opponents.
Only one thing in the account a little surprises me,
and that is the colonel&#8217;s order. If the officer was a
colonel, would a subaltern be able quietly to countermand
his orders? Is there not some mistake of rank
here, or perhaps a misunderstanding of an angry
exclamation?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Torgau.</span></h3>

<p>The populace at Torgau called them swine with
variations&mdash;all of which, alas, is exactly what has
been done, in some cases, by the populace on our side
too. At Torgau &#8220;the Commandant was a Prussian
reservist officer with a long heavy moustache. We were
told [by the other prisoners] that he was courteous and
considerate in every respect, and that, provided we
took care, to salute him whenever we passed him, we
should find him everything we could reasonably wish.&#8221;
And later, &#8220;It was a subject of universal regret when
the first Commandant resigned his position.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><span class="smcap">Dogs.</span></h3>

<p>A great deal has been made of the use of dogs in
some prison camps. The following is the account
given in Mr. O&#8217;Rorke&#8217;s book (page 41):</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>As time went on our numbers increased to about 230
British officers, and 800 French officers joined us from
Maubeuge, including four generals. One of the latter had
been interned in Torgau before, in the 1870 war, and had
made good his escape. The authorities guarded against the
recurrence of such an eventuality on the present occasion,
their most elaborate precaution being the enlistment of dogs
to reinforce their sentries. Their barkings could be heard
occasionally by night, but their presence disturbed neither
our repose nor our equanimity.</p></div>

<p>It is worth while to quote from a report made by
Dr. Ohnesorg and Mr. Dresel on Wittenberg in March,
1916:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The police dogs are not now a cause of complaint on the
part of the prisoners.&mdash;(<i>Miscel</i>. 16 [1916] p.&nbsp;85).</p></div>

<p>Dr. Austin in &#8220;My Experiences as a German
Prisoner&#8221; writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>For a long time previous to our arrival at Magdeburg
we had been informed that large and savage dogs were to
be provided to aid the sentries.... They were certainly
savage enough, but were always led by a sentry, or chained
in their den, and were never let loose on us. (p.&nbsp;141).</p></div>

<p>To return to Chaplain O&#8217;Rorke&#8217;s narrative: &#8220;When
we first arrived [the barrack warder] had adopted the
r&ocirc;le of gaoler in his demeanour towards us, but after
a while he became civil and deferential, and&mdash;when
his son was captured in the war&mdash;actually
sympathetic.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;45.) At Torgau &#8220;the meals,
though far from sumptuous and not always palatable,
were sufficient for our needs.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;43.)</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><span class="smcap">Burg.</span></h3>

<p>At Burg, at the canteen, &#8220;we used to treat one
another to a whole roll or a cake and a cup of excellent
coffee; and, until they were put on the <i>verboten</i> list,
to a chop or steak. The serving was done under the
direction of a kind, motherly <i>Frau</i> at the one canteen,
and by a polite German boy-waiter at the other....
The regular meals seemed to be provided by the
proprietor of the larger canteen under contract with
the German Government. They were served at 8
a.m., 12 noon and 6-30 p.m. In quality they were
superior to the Torgau fare, but in quantity scarcely
sufficient in the depth of winter for hungry young
men. Still it must be remembered that they cost
only 1s. 6d. a day&#8221; [out of the daily pay allowed].
Weekly baths were the regulation, but &#8220;it was often
possible for pushing natures to get an extra bath on
other days,&#8221; by a method which works all the world
over. At Burg &#8220;the new Commandant was a tall,
well-made, soldierly figure. He had a strong face,
curiously resembling an owl.&#8221; An amusing little
story follows as to the preciseness of the Commandant
and Mr. O&#8217;Rorke continues: &#8220;It is pleasant to add
that this new Commandant was in one respect just the
man that was needed. From the first day he began
to make the place hum, the foul clean, and in time
rendered it habitable. Had there been any, he would
have made the dust fly, but there was not. Indeed
the court was at first almost a bog through which we
threaded our way inch deep in mud, and hopped over
the pools. All this disappeared in a few weeks under
the Commandant&#8217;s direction; the swamp was drained
and the path widened.&#8221; British officials, too, know
that the problem of mud in a confined space trodden
by thousands of feet is one needing energy for its
solution.</p>

<p>The Commandant seems to have had a quality more
valuable even than energy&mdash;a capacity for learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>from those under him. He was a judge by profession,
and was at first stern and terrible, as well as thorough.
To him the prisoners were as ordinary prisoners, &#8220;but
in time he learnt to place us in a different category.
As for myself, eventually he granted me facilities for
carrying on my work outside the <i>Lager</i>, which he
might easily have refused, and when, five months
later, we parted, it was with a certain measure of
mutual cordiality&#8221; (p.&nbsp;74). The Adjutant also
learned more cordiality, and adjutants are sometimes
prouder of making others feel their authority than
commandants are.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Censor Fined by Prisoner.</span></h3>

<p>The Chaplain instituted a system of fines for
&#8220;unparliamentary expressions.&#8221; &#8220;Once I had to fine
the German censor. He was engaged on a hot day in
examining a very large number of packages before
distributing them to their owners. He let fall in an
unguarded moment the remark that it was a nuisance
to have to open so many parcels&mdash;specifying the
particular kind of nuisance he felt it to be ... but
unfortunately I overheard it and he had to pay the
penalty. He did so with a good grace.&#8221; A touch like
this seems to me, personally, to tell more eloquently
than many orations how absurd it is to be regarding
one another as all monsters who ought to be put out of
the world.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Visits Outside Camp.</span></h3>

<p>The hospital accommodation at the camp was very
poor, and a lieutenant was sent out to a hospital in the
town to have his little finger amputated. Mr.
O&#8217;Rorke asked for permission to visit him. The
Adjutant at once agreed. &#8220;It was not long before I
presented myself at the office for my escort. I
expected a couple of armed soldiers at the least,
remembering our reception at the hands of the
populace. Instead, my escort consisted of Herr Kost&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>friendly censor and interpreter&mdash;and a soldier.
&#8216;Are you going to run away?&#8217; asked Herr Kost. I
smiled at the futility of such an idea. &#8216;Then we
won&#8217;t take a soldier.&#8217; My journey of half an hour to
the hospital, my reception there, and my return to
the prison were unmarred by any unpleasant incident
whatever. The hospital was of the latest and best.
Lieut. George had nothing but words of gratitude
about the doctors and nurses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chaplain was allowed to visit the &#8220;reprisal
prisoners,&#8221; those put in solitary confinement owing to
the infliction of this penalty on the officers and men
of two German submarines. He found them well
treated. &#8220;The privacy of this little room,&#8221; said the
Hon. Ivan Hay &#8220;is preferable to the liberty and Babel
of the Burg dormitories.&#8221; The prisoners were
specially selected from families of distinction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prisoners and Populace.</span></h3>

<p>The other Burg prisoners were afterwards removed
to Mainz. &#8220;The German Commandant took pity on
my loneliness and offered me the privilege of going
into the town where and when I liked if I would give
my word of honour that I would make no attempt to
escape. I agreed to the proposal. We shook
hands over it, put it down in writing, and
he presented me with a passport for the period
of a week.&#8221; Mr. O&#8217;Rorke, dressed in khaki,
was soon the centre of a crowd of about twenty-five
boys and girls. But, and this is really worth our
noting, &#8220;they behaved extraordinarily well, and made
no offensive remark.&#8221; His followers increased, and
he made things worse by giving them sweets! He
called upon the German Pastor in order to get rid of
them, but even this failed. A long stop at a caf&eacute; did
not tire the vigilance of his escort. When he again
came out, there they were. &#8220;We exchanged smiles
and off we started.&#8221; A bookseller, whose shop Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>O&#8217;Rorke visited, came to his rescue and dispersed
most of the little crowd, but another one gathered
later, though again it showed no impoliteness or
unfriendliness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">MS. Returned.</span></h3>

<p>It remains to be said that Mr. O&#8217;Rorke&#8217;s diary was
confiscated on his release, but was restored to him by
post a few weeks later, marked as having passed the
German Censor!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Another Prisoner&#8217;s Report.</span></h3>

<p>Another useful little book of reminiscences is that
of Mr. L.&nbsp;J. Austin, F.R.C.S., of the British Red
Cross, &#8220;My Experiences as Prisoner in Germany.&#8221;
&#8220;About ten miles from Namur we suddenly ran into
the outposts of the German Army, consisting of a
picket of about twenty Uhlans, who examined our
papers, obligingly removed the tree from across the
road, and allowed us to proceed. Shortly afterwards
we were again held up, this time by an officer, who
re-examined us all, and again we were allowed to
proceed.... Near midday we came to a small
village called Maffe, and here we had the misfortune
to run straight into the head of the main German
Army marching upon Namur.&#8221; Detention was, under
the circumstances, practically inevitable. The party
could scarcely be allowed to motor off with valuable
information as to the position of the German Army
in their possession. They were indeed suspected of
being spies. Said an interpreter: &#8220;You know you&#8217;ve
been incredibly foolish to come anywhere near our
forces; you will not be able to return after seeing our
Army, but will have to be sent back into Germany.
I do not know what will become of you, but you will
be treated as gentlemen.&#8221; &#8220;During the afternoon of
the first day an officer of the Motor Cycle Corps who
spoke excellent English came in and had a friendly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>talk with us, and seemed to be inclined to laugh at the
position he found us in. We were struck by the
familiarity between the privates and some of the
officers. For instance, in this particular case, some
of the soldiers had practice rides on their officers&#8217;
motor-bicycles.&#8221; There followed a long interview
with Prince Heinrich, the 33rd of Reuss. He was very
suspicious, but polite. &#8220;Finally His Royal Highness
shook hands with us and said: &#8216;I do not know what
will become of you gentlemen, but probably you&#8217;ll be
sent back to Germany to assist in looking after
wounded soldiers of France and Belgium, and possibly
English if they are foolish enough to cross the
Channel.&#8217;&#8221; The prolonged detention of Mr. Austin
is inexcusable, but there seem to be somewhat
inexplicable detentions on both sides. A document
handed to the prisoners on their release was to this
effect: &#8220;The German Government advises the
English Government that unless all Red Cross units
at present in England are immediately returned, no
further exchange of British medical officers can be
contemplated.&#8221; [Cf. too Miscel. 30 (1916) pp.&nbsp;2, 36;
also International Red Cross Reports, First Series,
pp.&nbsp;18, 19.]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Credulity Once More.</span></h3>

<p>The general experiences of Mr. Austin are very
similar to those of Mr. O&#8217;Rorke. At Bouvigny &#8220;a
somewhat offensive non-commissioned officer ...
removed all knives that we had and was greatly
excited at the presence of the large jack-knife which
had been issued to us before we left. These knives
carried a long spike, for punching leather and opening
tins, and the story has been circulated in Germany
that these knives were issued to the troops for the
express purpose of gouging out the eyes of the German
wounded.&#8221; There is something pathetically hopeless
about these aspects of human credulity in war-time.
When we see the extraordinary nonsense that each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>side readily believes of the other, we must accept it as
something to the credit of human nature that any
reasonable treatment of prisoners occurs at all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ordinary Humanity.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;Our other personal effects,&#8221; the narrative goes on,
&#8220;including our money, were returned to us.&#8221; The
doctor&#8217;s papers had not been returned by the German
officers who originally examined him, and this fact
caused many delays and annoyances, but one does not
read of any actual ill-treatment. The use of dogs is
referred to (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_33">33</a>). The last incident on German
territory is thus recorded: &#8220;When the Holland train
drew in the officer had not returned, but one of our
party who spoke German well informed the sergeant
that the officers had told us we were to go by this
train, and he very obligingly placed us in it after we
had taken tickets to the nearest Dutch station,
Ozendaal.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reports of the International Red Cross.</span></h3>

<p>To me it seems that the Swiss have made some of
the finest efforts of the spirit during this war. It is
no mean achievement. Some are bound by many ties
of friendship to the German people, some to the
French. There has, of course, been occasional failure
and sheer partisanship, but an utterance such as that
of Carl Spitteler is marvellous in its determination to
do justice, and in its reverence for the suffering of all
the nations. The International Committee of the
Red Cross at Geneva has been a centre of kindliness
in the midst of carnage. In France and in Germany a
committee was, by mutual agreement, established
consisting of representatives of the national Red
Cross, of the American and Spanish Embassies, and
one delegate of the International Committee. These
committees arranged that delegates of the International
Committee should visit prisoners&#8217; camps in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>both countries. No such committee existed in Great
Britain, but with the consent of the British
authorities some camps in this country were visited in
January, 1915. (See footnote, page 9.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Camps: Food.</span></h3>

<p>In January, 1915, National Councillor A. Eugster
was deputed to visit French prisoners in Germany. In
general, the Swiss reports<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> give an almost exactly
similar impression to those made by the United States.
As regards the food, M. Eugster remarks that the sum
of 60 pf. (just over 7d.) is allowed daily for the German
private, and exactly the same sum for the prisoners.
In his second report, made in March, he points out
that the food question has become more serious and
(as far as his experience goes) complaints are more
numerous. He summarises very reasonably the
difficulties of the case, especially as regards the bread
problem. Prisoners were originally allowed 500
grammes daily, but when the bread rations of the
German civilians were reduced from 250 to 200
grammes, some reduction in the prisoners&#8217; allowance
was only to be expected, and their ration was fixed at
300 grammes. They would otherwise have been
allowed two and a half times as much as the Germans
themselves. Potato meal was allowed to make up the
quantity, but the result was not good. Writing in
March, M. Eugster says: &#8220;There are to-day from 750
to 800,000 prisoners in Germany. Allowing 300
grammes per man, this makes a daily consumption of
240,000 kilos. of bread (about 235 tons). This is not
a bagatelle at a moment when the importation of
cereals is impossible.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> By Art. 7 of the Hague rules
an arrangement between belligerents as to prisoners
should be possible, and Eugster suggests that meal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>might be sent under neutral care to the camps, and
bread baked there under neutral surveillance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Result.</span></h3>

<p>M. Eugster&#8217;s reports on the individual camps convey
almost exactly the same impression as the American
reports. At Sennelager the English doctor spoke
highly of the treatment of the wounded, and the
French doctors readily acknowledges that German
wounded and French wounded were treated alike. At
Zossen a sculptor was at work in his studio, a painter
painted landscapes, a gardener ornamented the
grounds, and a musician had his compositions rendered
by a choir of 150 to 200 practised singers. It is the
best educated prisoners, remarks the deputy, who are
the most content. Summarising the impressions of
his first tour, Herr Eugster says: &#8220;I am glad ...
to be able to assert that the French prisoners are
humanely treated. In such distracted times errors and
mistakes can easily occur, but on the whole one can
say that Germany does her duty by her French
prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not surprising to learn that M. Eugster received
anonymous letters reviling him for not producing
evidence to support the prejudices of the writers.
Some readers of this account may indeed be made
suspicious by his German name. M. Eugster was fully
alive to these suspicions, and he suggested that a
German and French Swiss might with advantage visit
camps jointly. The suggestion was carried out, and
in the third series of visits Dr. de Marval accompanied
him. The general evidence is as before.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vermin.</span></h3>

<p>The Swiss reports are in some respects more outspoken
than the American ones. The heading &#8220;vermin&#8221;
occurs in almost all. It requires a special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>campaign to deal with the lice, but the campaign
seems to be carried on with vigour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tact.</span></h3>

<p>There is another point. &#8220;We must not forget,&#8221;
writes Eugster, &#8220;that to be a prisoner is in itself a
very trying fate.&#8221; It needs a little contact with
prisoners to realise <i>how</i> hard their fate is, and how
easily the wrong way with them may produce soured
and embittered men. Writing of Halle in May,
Eugster and de Marval remark: &#8220;The relationship
between the Commandant and the prisoners is
correct, but without cordiality; the subordinates were
often wanting in tact.&#8221; I confess it is simple words
like these that depress me more than rumours of
starvation or bad housing. Anyone knows that
authority does not readily become the friend of the
fallen. The military manner, even when acquired by
Englishmen, is not always pleasant, and the sergeant
who bullies his own men is not likely to be more considerate
to prisoners. Let us face plain facts in these
matters, and remember that all imprisonment is
rather terrible, and that all absolute authority
(especially among underlings) is apt to become
tyrannous. In the prison camps of every nation it is
examples of a foolish military officialdom that make
for embitterment and degradation; and in these
camps, too, it is the tact which comes of true insight,
that is doing much for that brotherhood of hearts
which is the only way to peace. &#8220;These people,&#8221;
says Eugster in another place, &#8220;ought to be treated
with tact. They should not be treated as enemy
prisoners, but as men and chivalrous adversaries. A
little consideration, not costing much, will make a
good impression. A friendly word, as from man to
man, breaks the ice of discontent, and the chivalrous
spirit of the superior is recognised with gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>To reach this standard we must try to think the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>of our adversaries. Charity is something less meagre
than justice, and it holds the future of the world in its
grasp. In the past we denounced French, Russians,
Irish and Boers in turn. It was not denunciation that
did much for the future, but the larger-hearted charity
which took its place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prisoners in France.</span></h3>

<p>M. de Marval reports well of the feeding of prisoners
in France. There is the usual difficulty about vermin.
The officer prisoners seem, in many ways, to have the
worst time. &#8220;Their lodging is in general too crowded,
badly ventilated, and badly lighted ... and lacking
in elementary comforts. They can ... buy ...
chairs, tables, blankets, etc.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> There was in France,
as elsewhere, considerable complaint in the earlier
days as to the delivery of parcels. The parcels
arrived broken and partly or wholly emptied of their
contents. So it was, we may remember, with parcels
intended for English prisoners in Germany. The
probability is that in both cases imperfect packing was
responsible for the damage. (Cf. pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_6">6</a>, <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.) In the
report just cited, De Marval states that, in general,
there has been great improvement in the lodging of
the prisoners, and that some bad camps (Vitr&eacute;,
Lorient, Belle-Ile) have been broken up (January,
1915). Here again the reports coincide with those
made upon German camps. In all countries the
prisoners of war presented at first a problem not
readily solved, and great hardships resulted. &#8220;Some
of the hospitals,&#8221; writes M. de Marval, &#8220;lack comforts,
are not sufficiently roomy, or do not possess the
necessary medicaments.&#8221; He goes on: &#8220;I shall not
delay over the retrospective complaints often formulated
by prisoners.... Officers who had been
injured by the populace or bound during transport and
soldiers who had told me of bad treatment were alike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>pleased to declare that all such things were past.&#8221;
Here again the report is exactly paralleled by the
American report on the German Camps. (Cf. p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_16">16</a>).
&#8220;Religious services are in general arranged for the
Catholics; it is very difficult to secure ministrations
for the Protestants.&#8221; &#8220;If the officers are often meanly
lodged, the same is true of the soldiers. The bedding
sometimes leaves much to be desired, the straw in
many of the camps is scanty, damp, and pretty often
full of lice. The litter is actually being replaced
everywhere by straw palliasses. As a support for
these an open wooden framework is placed on the
beaten ground which is often wet. Those who sleep
under tents are subject to bronchitis and rheumatism,
those who are in forts or old convents sometimes lack
the proper allowance of air.... Though the
quality of the water leaves something to be desired, it
is supplied filtered and boiled, and in amount generally
sufficient.... In some camps there is not enough
water for washing either the person or clothing....
In general each man has a blanket, but it is very small
and often much worn; some are still needed in some of
the camps.... If I have not referred to certain
regrettable incidents of which I have been told, it is
because they appear isolated, and one must guard
against generalising from them. Besides, these
incidents are bygones and few in number.&#8221; At
Foug&egrave;res (Brittany) &#8220;the beds are touching each
other.&#8221; Cassabianda was a bad camp. So much has
been made of earlier defects in German camps that it
is well to remember (as indeed the above report
shows) that defects may easily occur in other
countries besides Germany. Of Cassabianda (February
12)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> we read: &#8220;Huts extremely dilapidated.
Sanitary accommodation worse than scanty. (<i>Les
W.&mdash;C. sont plus que sommaires</i>). Nourishment
scarcely sufficient for those who are working....
The cooking arrangements are worse than scanty....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Sleeping accommodation extraordinary: beds made
from boughs by prisoners and superposed in two or
three tiers. The ceilings and windows are falling in
ruins.... Wishes of the prisoners&mdash;to have more to
eat.... A very poor camp (<i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t tr&egrave;s m&eacute;diocre</i>),
but well governed by a good and conscientious commandant
who is badly seconded by his officers. It is
a difficult task to render habitable premises that are
falling into ruins.&#8221; I am quite sure that none of us
would impute ill intent to the French authorities. We
should say simply that the prisoner problem was at
first beyond their power, that in exceptional cases
there were bad officers and in others lack of organisation.
If we are capable of fair play, we shall, in many
cases, say exactly the same thing about the German
authorities. In Germany the one outstanding question
is food, otherwise, as M.M. de Marval and
Eugster state in a joint report issued in May: &#8220;We
fully recognise the excellent arrangement and perfect
organisation, thought out to the smallest detail, and
the admirable administration of the Camps.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Later U.S. Reports.</span></h3>

<p>It is allowed by all investigators that camps almost
everywhere have been improved as the war went on.
Mr. Gerard himself writes, under date June 10, 1915:
&#8220;It is generally admitted that conditions in the camps
are constantly improving, and no good can be attained
by the investigations of complaints based upon
reports of conditions as they are supposed to have been
several months ago.&#8221; In citing the <i>earlier</i> U.S. and
Swiss reports I have therefore by no means exaggerated
the facts favourable to German treatment. There
have been many later reports, but it will be impossible
and unnecessary to give more than a few references:</p>

<p>The reports in Miscel. No. 15 (1915) give a quite
favourable account of the German efforts on behalf of
the prisoners. Canadian officers at Bischofswerda,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>however, complained of their treatment on the way
from the front. They said that &#8220;they were at first
compelled to share their compartments with French
Algerian (black) soldiers, but that other arrangements
were made by a German officer in the course of
their journey.&#8221; Some may consider this an interesting
comment on the employment of Algerian and
other native troops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hunger During Transport.</span></h3>

<p>The Canadian officers also said &#8220;that while on the
road they had received but little food, their treatment
not differing, however, from that of other prisoners.&#8221;
On reading this I could not help recalling a <i>Daily News</i>
interview headed &#8220;The Blue Ladies: Good work at
the Free Buffet at Euston.&#8221; (June 24, 1916.) &#8220;We
have just had the escort of some German prisoners
in,&#8221; said one of the ladies. &#8220;We do not give anything
to the prisoners. We have enough to do to look
after our own men.&#8221; I recalled, too, the British
nurse who said in my presence, with a snap of her
fingers, &#8220;We have not <i>that</i> much sympathy with the
German wounded.&#8221; I want to believe that in the
great majority of cases the attitude on both sides is
very different; but what a sundering influence war-like
patriotism is! We must surely reach brotherhood
by some other way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Friedrichsfeld.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Michelson reports highly of the camp at
Friedrichsfeld. All kinds of work was going on. &#8220;No
German foreman were to be seen, and only on looking
for them did I notice that there were, here and
there, guards watching the prisoners. In two
instances I saw unguarded prisoners at work.&#8221; Some
wounded at Magdeburg &#8220;all, without exception, said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>they had been treated with great consideration while
being transported from the front.&#8221; (June 3, 1915).
The hospital treatment is spoken well of both here and
at the base hospital at Isighem, W. Flanders,
visited by Dr. Ohnesorg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Organisation and Reciprocity.</span></h3>

<p>I pass on to Miscel. No. 19 (1915). Writing in
June, Mr. Gerard gives an interesting account of the
courses of instruction and lectures arranged for
German N.C.O.&#8217;s and men in order to increase their
efficiency in managing the camp kitchens. There is a
characteristic touch of German thoroughness in the
scheme. Mr. Gerard concludes: &#8220;I should be glad
to have you bring the foregoing to the attention of the
British Government. The German military authorities
have now satisfied themselves that German
prisoners in England are being treated as well as the
conditions admit (except with regard to the confinement
on board ships, which is still a sore point), and
they are showing every disposition to treat British
prisoners (both officers and men) in the most favourable
manner possible, and to pay attention to their wishes
in so far as can be done consistently with the principle
that all the prisoners (of whom there are considerably
more than one million) must be treated in practically
the same manner.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lazarets.</span></h3>

<p>Writing from Hamburg, the American Consul-General,
Mr. Morgan, says: &#8220;It is not necessary for
me to enter into the details of the different lazarets
which I visited, beyond stating that they are all in the
most up-to-date condition, and everything is being
done for the wounded that could be done anywhere.&#8221;
At the Paderborn lazarets, &#8220;Some of the men said to
me that it would be necessary to drive them away
(that they would make no attempt to escape) because
they were so well cared for and so comfortable.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>(p.&nbsp;40, l.c.) At the Wesel lazarets, &#8220;Many of (the
British) were very uncomfortable from their wounds,
but all replied that their present treatment, as well as
that which they had received at the front, and on the
way from the front, was, and had been, entirely satisfactory....
All those consulted in regard to the
matter said that they had come from the front in a
German lazaret train, together with German wounded,
and that, as nearly as they could tell, they had
received exactly similar treatment and care as
accorded to the German wounded. Their only request
was for books and tobacco.&#8221; (October 26, 1915.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Difficulty.</span></h3>

<p>At Neubrandenburg, &#8220;until a few days ago the
officers were permitted to use a tennis court outside
the enclosure, to swim in the lake, and to walk in the
neighbouring woods. As four officers (one Englishman)
made an attempt to escape (from the bath
house) these privileges were temporarily suspended,
but I was told by the Commandant, whose relations
with the prisoners are of the best, that they would be
restored at an early date.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excellence of the bathing facilities at the
officers&#8217; camp, Friedberg, is commented on, as it
frequently is in other cases. At Giessen, Dr. Ohnesorg
spoke with many prisoners who had had experience of
working camps. &#8220;They said (the work) was not
hard, and before being allotted to these various
working camps, they underwent a thorough medical
examination, and those who were found in an unfit
physical condition were not detailed for this work.
They are fed and housed by their employer, and in one
instance I met a complaint of insufficient food.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some Officer Camps.</span></h3>

<p>At Bad Blenhorst a number of prisoner officers are
taking the &#8220;cure&#8221; under a German military surgeon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>At Clausthal &#8220;the situation of the camp is ideal,
being placed in the midst of the Hartz mountains,
with a wide expanse of view, and my visit gave me a
very favourable impression in general.&#8221; At C&uuml;strin
&#8220;The German officers treat the prisoners like
unfortunate comrades.&#8221; At Bischofswerda the complaints
were that &#8220;shorts&#8221; were forbidden for football,
and that baths were not allowed more than once
daily. The Commandant promised to remedy both
grievances. The report on Halle is unfavourable.
There was overcrowding, and &#8220;the enclosure for
exercise leaves much to be desired.&#8221; The food was
not complained of, except as regards monotony.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">K&#339;nigsbrueck, Zwickau, G&ouml;rlitz.</span></h3>

<p>K&ouml;nigsbr&uuml;ck, a camp for 15,000 prisoners (but with
only three British), &#8220;is complete in all respects, and
adheres to a high standard in regard to the kitchens,
theatre, washing-places, canteens, supply-room for
clothing, etc.&#8221; Zwickau (with two British) &#8220;is
excellent ... outside each barrack is a specially
built stand where the mattresses are aired every
day ... and within the confines of the camp are
several acres of vegetable gardens ... in which the
French take particular interest.&#8221; The arrangements
at G&ouml;rlitz (with thirteen British) &#8220;in all details
struck me as being exceedingly good.&#8221; In general
hospital treatment at the camps is entirely satisfactory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Schloss Celle, Wittenberg, Stendal, Food.</span></h3>

<p>In Miscel. No. 16 (1916) we may note the following:
At the officers&#8217; camp, Schloss Celle, &#8220;the
Commandant in civil life is a judge, and seemed on
excellent terms with the prisoners.&#8221; Mr. Gerard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>reports on a visit of his own to Wittenberg on
November 8, 1915. The soup for the mid-day meal
appeared to him &#8220;to be very good,&#8221; and the testimony
of the men was to the effect &#8220;that the food had
improved considerably during the last two months.&#8221;
About 300 out of the 4,000 prisoners in this camp
were British.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At Stendal Mr. Osborne found the
thick soup &#8220;exceedingly palatable, though thoroughly
un-English.&#8221; The British prisoners &#8220;admitted that
they could live on the camp rations, if necessary, and
still retain good health, as is the case with the
Russians, and that their objection to the food was on
account of its sameness, and because it was not
cooked in an English way.&#8221; In March, 1916, Mr.
Osborne reports that a large swimming pool is in
process of completion at one end of the camp.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reports and Information.</span></h3>

<p>At Fort Friedrichshafen, Ingolstadt, &#8220;those who
had no overcoats said that they could get them from
the German authorities if necessary, but that they
preferred to wait for the present to see if they could
not be sent from home. All would like new boots, as
they are not pleased with the wooden-soled boots
provided locally.&#8221; Sir Edward Grey, writing just
before the receipt of this report, referred to information
&#8220;that the few British prisoners of war at this
camp are very badly fed, and that parcels arrive with
great irregularity, their contents being frequently
abstracted.&#8221; In a reply dated a week later, Mr.
Gerard (U.S. Ambassador at Berlin) writes that &#8220;in
reply to a direct inquiry, which was made out of the
hearing of any German officer or man,&#8221; the British
prisoners at Ingolstadt &#8220;stated that there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>nothing to which they would care to have special
attention paid. The men were in good spirits, and
there was no evidence to show that any of them were
badly fed. All were in touch with their friends at
home, and no complaint was made with regard to
irregularity in the receipt of parcels.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Favourable and Humorous.</span></h3>

<p>Of the officers&#8217; camp at Blankenberg i/Mark,
Messrs. Jackson and Russell report, &#8220;The atmosphere
of the camp is excellent.&#8221; There is a touch of
humour in the report on Merseburg (l.c. p.&nbsp;29). &#8220;One
man complained to me that he had been punished for
&#8216;having a hole in his trousers&#8217; (as he said), but on
investigation I found that he had cut a new pair of
trousers, which had been given him by the German
authorities, in order to make a pair of boxing shorts.
One man had a black eye, another a sprained thumb,
and a third a broken nose, as the result of boxing
matches.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The four English prisoners at K&ouml;nigsmoor
said &#8220;that there was no discrimination against
them of any kind, and their relations with the German
guard were evidently pleasant. They all said that
they had plenty of warm clothing, including overcoats,
and one even had an overcoat which had been
given him by the German authorities in addition to
one which he had received from home. They said the
food was &#8216;not bad&#8217; ...&#8221; At the working camp at
Hakenmoor, &#8220;the midday &#8216;soup&#8217; was excellent....
All looked in good health and seemed to be
contented, and their relations with the German
guards appeared to be friendly.... Several complained
that the clothing furnished soon became too
tight for comfort, and nearly every man in the camp
had put on from ten to thirty (even more) pounds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>flesh. None spoke of any bad treatment ...
although one Englishman said that there were
occasional differences with the (Belgian) barrack
captains. The Commandant is interested in his work;
he knows most of the men by name, and seems to try
to do all in his power to add to their comfort.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Food.</span></h3>

<p>In these reports the food is almost invariably
referred to as good, and to save further quotations we
may cite the evidence at G&uuml;strow i/Mecklenburg as
giving a fair general view of the case (January, 1916):
&#8220;The men told me that while they depend on their
home parcels for variety, a man who received nothing
(as is the case with the Russian prisoners) could live
on the food supplied, although in that case he would
always be glad when meal time came.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Atmosphere.&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>At Dyr&ouml;tz, &#8220;the general atmosphere of the camp
certainly seemed excellent, both on the part of the
men and on the part of the authorities.&#8221; (January,
1916.) At Blankenburg &#8220;the Commandant has now
adopted the practice of taking different officer
prisoners of war with him for occasional walks in the
neighbouring country.&#8221; &#8220;In a lazaret at Spandau,&#8221;
writes Mr. Jackson, &#8220;I sat alone with Captain
Coulston in the good-sized, comfortably furnished
room which he occupies by himself.... Recently he
had had a conversation with Her Royal Highness the
Princess Friedrich Leopold of Prussia, who visited the
lazaret, but ordinarily he had little opportunity to
talk, as he speaks only a few words of German, French,
or Russian. On my speaking of this, I was told that
an effort would be made to have English-speaking
German officers call on him from time to time.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><span class="smcap">German Professors.</span></h3>

<p>Attention is again drawn to the excellent work of
Prof. Stange at G&ouml;ttingen. &#8220;He has an office in the
camp at which he is present for two hours every day,
during which time he can be consulted by any
prisoner, and has formed classes of study, which are
well attended.&#8221; At Giessen, too, &#8220;Prof. Gmelin of
the local university has taken a great interest in the
prisoners and visits them regularly with a view to
providing for their instruction.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Contradiction.</span></h3>

<p>The following is important and I quote it in full.
<i>Mr. Osborne to Mr. Gerard.</i> (<i>February 23, 1916</i>)
(l.c. p.&nbsp;62.):</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>In accordance with your instructions and with reference
to the article in the London <i>Times</i> of February 7, stating
the report of an exchanged British prisoner of war that two
British prisoners at the detention camp at G&uuml;strow, in
Mecklenburg, had been bayonetted for smoking in a forbidden
vicinity, and that one had died and the other was
still in hospital, I have the honour to inform you that I
visited the camp at G&uuml;strow on February 12, 1916. I did
not notify the camp authorities of my arrival. I was shown
every courtesy and received every facility for speaking to
the British prisoners out of earshot of the Germans. I
talked with a large number of British non-commissioned
officers and with some of the men, and all were unanimous on
two points; first, that if such an occurrence as the one mentioned
had taken place, they would certainly have heard of
it; and, second, that they had heard of no such occurrence.
I visited the lazaret, through which I was taken by a British
N.C.O., who is an assistant in caring for the sick, and spoke
to every British patient under treatment there, not one of
whom could possibly have been suffering from a bayonet
wound. It seems to me quite out of the question that the
occurrence mentioned in the English newspaper accounts could
have actually taken place at G&uuml;strow.</p>

<p>In point of fact, instead of complaints at G&uuml;strow, I heard
rather praise of the camp from the British interned there,
and praise of the British prisoners from the camp authorities.
The men were all well fitted out with clothes of all sorts, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>seemed particularly cheerful. The authorities stated that it
had never been necessary, in recent times at least, to place a
British prisoner under arrest. On the whole, the camp
struck me as being as nearly ideal as it is possible for a
place of detention of this kind to be.</p></div>

<p>The discrepancy between the last sentence in Mr.
Osborne&#8217;s report and the <i>Times</i> article is a striking
one. It should give one pause in placing too much
reliance upon untested accusations, or upon newspaper
articles based upon them. We forget sometimes that
all the bias is <i>against</i> an enemy, and the only stories
likely to be free from exaggeration are those told in
his favour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Military Prison.</span></h3>

<p>In the military prison at Cologne (Miscel. 16 [1916]
p.&nbsp;67), &#8220;the prisoners receive the same food and the
same general treatment as the German military
prisoners, with whom they are permitted to talk....
The prisoners are not permitted to receive food from
outside sources.... Generally speaking the conditions
do not differ materially from those in an ordinary
working camp.... Corporal B. was found guilty of
lack of respect to his British superior, Corporal J.
was punished for striking the French non-commissioned
officer in charge of his barrack, and Corporals
O. and S. had trouble with the German Landsturmmann
in charge of a cooking party....&#8221; Most of the
sentences were for striking work at various work
centres, the men sentenced stating that the conditions
were bad. There was a special complaint against the
railway work at Langen-Halbach b/Haiger, but not all
the British joined in the strike. &#8220;I saw the men&#8217;s midday
meal, consisting of a thick porridge which
appeared to be nutritious. One man claimed that it
was thicker to-day than usual, but several of his comrades
contradicted this flatly. No complaints were
made to me of any rough treatment in the Gef&auml;ngnis
[prison].&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><span class="smcap">Bavarian Courtesy.</span></h3>

<p>The Venerable Archdeacon Wm. E. Nies, who had
been given permission to visit British prisoners of war
in Bavaria, writes: &#8220;I think it is only fair to comment
favourably upon the friendly way in which my
mission to the men is received and furthered by the
commanders without exception thus far.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hospital Treatment.</span></h3>

<p>Of Germersheim hospitals we read: &#8220;The food
served in these hospitals is exceptionally satisfactory.
Dr. Algeron, the chief surgeon in charge, a broad-minded
man and indefatigable worker, attends personally
to the catering.... Under this regime there
have been some noteworthy increases in weight....&#8221;</p>

<p>At Bayreuth a private of the Black Watch had been
&#8220;removed&mdash;for the purpose of electrical treatment of
his arm by which it is hoped to avoid an operation&mdash;to
the military lazaret in the city, which is an admirably
equipped modern hospital.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wuensdorf, Crefeld.</span></h3>

<p>We pass now to reports in Miscel. No. 26 (1916).
Indian prisoners of war at W&uuml;nsdorf (Zossen) find
their treatment &#8220;very good.&#8221; At Crefeld officers&#8217;
camp, &#8220;the walks on parole ... have been entirely
successful.... The only complaint as to these was
that the German accompanying the party was a non-commissioned
instead of a regular officer. This will,
however, be rectified at once.... There is no trouble
of any kind with the inhabitants on these.... The
relations with the camp authorities are excellent.&#8221; As
regards the behaviour of the inhabitants, I would refer
also to Chaplain O&#8217;Rorke&#8217;s statement (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_36">36</a>),
though, as one would expect, the inhabitants have in
some other cases behaved badly (<i>e.g.</i>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_32">32</a>).</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span><span class="smcap">Muenster II., Muenster III.</span></h3>

<p>At M&uuml;nster II, &#8220;The Commandment, General von
Ey-Steinecke, as well as the other officers, and the
general treatment, are well spoken of by the men.&#8221;
Some improvements suggested on March 16 were
already started on the 18th. At M&uuml;nster III. the
benches in the English Chapel &#8220;were provided at the
expense of the camp, although the British prisoners
offered to pay for them.... The camp authorities
have endeavoured to arrange courses of instruction
with some success, and several British are taking
lessons in French.... Sergeant Middleditch, the
ranking non-commissioned officer, who has taken an
active part in the work of improvement, stated that
the relations with the camp authorities were excellent,
and that the officers showed much consideration in
acceding to reasonable requests. The commandant,
General Raitz von Frentz, is well spoken of by all, and
shows a liberal and progressive spirit in dealing with
such difficulties as arise.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parchim, Brandenburg.</span></h3>

<p>From Miscel. No. 7 (1917) a few extracts may be
made. Of Parchim Dr. A.&nbsp;E. Taylor and Mr. J.&nbsp;P.
Webster write: &#8220;We believe that special commendation
should be given to the Commandant, Oberst
Kothe, for the spirit in which he governs the camp,
and for the way in which he does everything in his
power for the welfare of the prisoners, and for the promotion
of a cordial relationship between the men and
those in charge.&#8221; Of Brandenburg, Mr. Jackson
writes candidly: &#8220;The part of the building occupied
by the British prisoners was not so clean as the
remainder, but for this the men themselves are
responsible.&#8221; It is obvious that the spirit as to this
and other matters will vary in every country among
different sets of men (c.f., <i>e.g.</i>, below the very
different G&uuml;strow report).</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><span class="smcap">Cottbus.</span></h3>

<p>Men in hospital at Cottbus &#8220;said that the food was
good and their treatment excellent.&#8221; Men in the
main camp complained that bread sent to them from
Switzerland and England arrived in a mouldy condition,
but &#8220;as the mouldiness seemed to start in the
middle of the loaf, they thought this was due to the
quality of the bread itself or the manner in which it
was packed.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Absence on Leave.</span></h3>

<p>At Celle, where &#8220;inactive officers&#8221; and some others
are detained, Mr. Jackson found one British subject
absent on leave, while &#8220;several others have been
permitted to make visits to their families in Germany.
A request from another, who had obtained no benefit
from his stay at Bad Blenhorst, for permission to go
somewhere for a &#8216;cure&#8217; is under consideration.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Limbau, Guestrow.</span></h3>

<p>At the working camp at Limbau (occupied Russian
territory) &#8220;the men described the commandant as a
&#8216;gentleman,&#8217; and said they had no difficulty in communicating
with him in regard to their wishes. None
had any complaint to make of their treatment, and
only a very few spoke of the work as hard.&#8221; The
camp contained 500 British prisoners.</p>

<p>At G&uuml;strow, &#8220;the treatment of the men and the
conditions found in their camp appeared to be very
favourable. The commandant stated that the British
were the most satisfactory prisoners under his
care....&#8221; Two million, five hundred thousand
letters passed through the camp post office in the previous
year, and about sixty thousand packages were
distributed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hospital Treatment.</span></h3>

<p>Hospital treatment is again and again described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>favourably in the individual reports (<i>e.g.</i>,
pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_4">4</a>, <a href="#Page_6">6</a>, <a href="#Page_14">14</a>, <a href="#Page_22">22</a>, <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_57">57</a>), but the opinion may here be
cited of a Swiss doctor who has been occupied in
German hospitals during most of the war:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The writer of these lines never saw anything anywhere that
could be considered as intentional change for the worse in the
lot of prisoners and sick; on the contrary, he was able to
ascertain that the prisoners and the sick are treated in a
manner that could not be more humane. If later on the food
was insufficient, the English must be aware of the reasons
which brought about far-reaching starvation among great
circles of the population of Germany.... From deepest
conviction the writer of these lines affirms that the German
people and the German doctors are [generally] without guilt
in the face of the accusations made against them. Individual
exceptions, if proved, could not alter this judgment.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Repatriations.</span></h3>

<p>There are bad stories of men arriving half-starving at
the British and French lines at the time of the general
repatriations. It would require care and impartiality
to sift these. The more experience one gains, the less
one trusts the average newspaper report in war-time.
It seems very probable that, as Erzberger contended,
many prisoners made off of their own accord after the
German Revolution, and the straits to which these
men were reduced could scarcely be ascribed to the
German authorities. That there were brutal cases of
men being <i>driven</i> away is also quite probable. As
regards the general question of prisoners, Erzberger
said: &#8220;If England can now actually prove that English
prisoners of war have been illegally treated, I give
my word no guilty person shall go unpunished. But
allow me the counter question, Is it known in enemy
countries how <i>German</i> prisoners of war were frequently
treated? I do not believe that is sufficiently
well known. Only listen to our soldiers who come
from France....&#8221; (Berlin, Nov., 24, 1918, <i>Wolff</i>.)
It should be obvious that both sides must be heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>before justice can decide, but the obvious is the
unrecognised in war time. And probably even by the
best and most impartial judgment only very rough
generalisations can be arrived at. One need seems to
me paramount, that each side shall become once
more aware of the <i>good</i> in the other. Here, then, are
one or two favourable facts from repatriated men:
&#8220;We understand that the Germans could not let us
march to the frontier, as we were prepared to do, lest
we should start to plunder the inhabitants. For the
same reason we were accompanied on the train by a
German N.C.O. with a rifle. At night we slept in
school buildings at Zevenaar (?) where we were given
food and coal, and were well treated. We gave some
of our food there to Sisters for the poor.... We had
not to pay any fare at Wesel. The Germans on the
train wished to be very friendly. We understand that
the German authorities helped to make the arrangements
about our taking the train at Wesel. No
special compartments were put on for us. We
travelled with the ordinary passengers.&#8221; (<i>Daily News</i>,
November 25, 1918.)</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The first contingent of British prisoners from Germany to
arrive in London under the terms of the armistice reached
Cannon Street Station from Dover yesterday. The party,
numbering nearly 300, were provided with hot refreshments
on arrival. The men looked remarkably fit, and one of the
party explained that they had mostly been working on the
railways behind the lines, and their treatment had been
fairly good.</p>

<p>Another contingent of returned prisoners, numbering about
800, arrived at Dover yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p class="signature">(<i>Daily News</i>, Nov. 21, 1918.)</p></div>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i> has honourably distinguished itself
by publishing favourable articles by repatriated
prisoners. An officer writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Three days ago I arrived in England after having spent
eight months in a German prison camp. We were among the
first repatriated prisoners of war to come through Switzerland,
and were secretly amused at the attitude of friends
and relatives on our arrival home. They seemed to be quite
surprised because most of us were looking healthy and fit,
and were not walking skeletons or physical wrecks.</p>

<p>But after reading the home newspapers, we understood
their point of view. I do not for one moment suggest that
these tales of inhuman treatment are untrue or exaggerated,
because I know many cases which confirm them;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but I do
say that this horrible treatment has not been general, nor
does it apply to all prisoners of war. For this reason I am
writing of what I know of the prisoners in Baden, in
Southern Germany, and I hope that this article may allay
the anxiety of those who are daily expecting some dear one
home, and who fear that he will be terribly changed through
suffering.</p></div>

<p>Men behind the lines had suffered far more,
this officer considered. This is somewhat at variance
with the extract last cited. The writer continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>But the lot of the prisoners in the permanent camps in
Baden was much brighter. My authority for saying so is an
old Roman Catholic priest, Father Nugent, a native of
Lancashire, I believe, who was in Southern Germany when
the war broke out. He had free access to all prison camps
and hospitals in Baden, and had no stories of harsh and
brutal treatment to tell. Two American doctors were
allowed to visit the hospitals in Rastatt, Lazaret 4, and the
Russenlager Hospital. They said that the patients were
comfortable and well looked after, in spite of the great
shortage of medical supplies in Germany.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers had a good time working on the
Baden farms. One orderly at our camp, who was away for
a fortnight in the fruit season, picking plums, told me that
he had met one of his old regiment working on a farm. This
man had just driven in to the railway station for the Red
Cross parcels, and told him that they were working with an
old German and his wife. They shared rations with each
other, and once a week the whole household visited the
cinema.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Delay in repatriation occurred owing to disorganisation.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>But there is no ill feeling towards the prisoners in Baden.
After the armistice we wandered at will round Freiburg and
in the Black Forest; and everyone was treated with civility.
There were no cases of open hostility at all.</p>

<p class="signature">(<i>Daily News</i>, Dec. 18, 1918.)</p></div>

<p>Mr. G.&nbsp;G. Desmond volunteered at the age of 46.
He was taken prisoner and gave (<i>Daily News</i>, Dec. 10,
1918) some account of his general outlook after his
imprisonment. Unlike some of the stay-at-homes he
can still believe in the German people, as the following
concluding paragraphs of his article show:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The soldiers and the country people round D&uuml;lmen, and
afterwards everybody we met in those parts, expressed no
sense of rancour at their defeat, and simply leapt over it all
to the prime, joyful fact that the <i>Krieg</i> was <i>fertig</i>. Everybody
greeted you with that, and covered his face with smiles
thereby. Some said that the terms were very hard, but
agreed with me when I told them that they were made hard
in order to defeat thoroughly the old gang and ensure a
lasting peace. I wish I felt as certain now as then that the
Allies had that clean intention. One farmer chuckled when
he told me that Germany must give up a hundred and fifty
U-boats, because, he said, she had no such number.</p>

<p>One of the political parties, I am afraid I cannot remember
which, published a manifesto stating that Germany had
been deceived and betrayed by the military party, whereby
among other things she inflicted great wrongs on Belgium
and the Allies, and that she must pay in full for those
wrongs. I do not doubt that is a widespread feeling in
Germany. If, however, the terms of peace are to be vindictive,
we shall in turn be in the wrong, and the new
Germany may have better cause than the old to hate us.</p>

<p>When we were fighting the Kaiser, we took pains to tell
the German people that we were fighting their battle against
their enemies. We were, in fact, liberating the traditional
distressed damsel from the clutches of the ogre. It was a
pity that so many of our blows fell upon the damsel and
not on the ogre. It would be not only a pity but a crime and
a grievous blunder if, now that the damsel is free, we proceeded
to thrash her for the faults of the ogre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The Germans, apart from their late Government, are not
Orientals intent upon deceiving us at every turn. They say
they have turned over a new leaf, and I am thoroughly
persuaded that they speak the truth. In business of all
kinds, under circumstances that made it very easy for them
to have cheated me, I found them, during my stay at
D&uuml;lmen, the straightest people I ever had anything to do
with. They think the same of us. Feldwebels and others
who have had to do with us both assured me that they much
preferred the British to any other class of prisoner, because
we are blunt and true, say what we mean, and stick to what
we say. Certainly the Germans are the most English of the
great peoples on the Continent.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h3>

<p>Our survey of the reliable evidence at present
available seems to me to prove that there has usually
been a serious effort in Germany to treat military
prisoners well. This does not imply that their lot is
otherwise than hard, and the prolongation of the
imprisonment adds terribly to the hardship. It is
impossible to banish from one&#8217;s mind such horrors as
those of Wittenberg, but it is quite plain that these
were very far from typical. When militarism goes
wrong, it goes very wrong. If we consider the special
German difficulties with regard to prisoners, and the
special dangers of the militarist state, we may, I
think, conclude a very fair standard of humanity
amongst the German people from the fact that in so
large a proportion of cases treatment has been reasonable
and in many even excellent.</p>

<p>I have no wish to arouse any resentment, and in
case this conclusion should do so, I quote here a
further neutral opinion, that of a well-known
Norwegian, M.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;E. Steen, who had been allowed to
visit prisoners&#8217; camps in Britain, France, and Germany.
M. Steen gave a lecture at the Queen&#8217;s (Small)
Hall on July 15, 1915, under the auspices of the
British Red Cross Society. Sir Louis Mallet presided.
According to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> report, &#8220;M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Steen spoke favourably to the conditions prevailing at
the various internment camps he visited in Germany,
and expressed the hope that his remarks would remove
misgivings and allay anxiety. The general impression
which the camps made on him, he said, was &#8216;very
satisfactory.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>We must remember, too, that in Germany also all
kinds of rumours and statements have circulated with
regard to the treatment of prisoners and wounded by
us and our Allies (cf. pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_2">2</a>, <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, <a href="#Page_38">38</a>, and <a href="#Page_80">80</a>). Such
rumours and exaggerations are apparently a part of
war. On the other side they have not made for a
benevolent attitude, and the really large amount of
interest openly shown in prisoners of war by such men
as Prince Lichnowsky, Prof. Stange, Prof. Gmelin,
the G&ouml;ttingen Pastors, and others, is a remarkable
fact. We realise this the more, when we consider that
it is not easy on this side for men in prominent positions
openly to show interest in German prisoners of
war.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Camps in U.K.</span></h3>

<p>It would be interesting to compare the U.S. reports
on British camps with their reports on German ones.
Unfortunately any useful comparison is impossible. A
collection of reports on &#8220;various internment camps
in the United Kingdom&#8221; is published in White Paper
No. 30 (1916), but the earliest inspection here
recorded took place on February 21, 1916. As the
chief difficulties everywhere occurred earlier, the
earlier reports are plainly necessary for a fair comparison.
&#8220;Are we as compassionate to our prisoners
as our ancestors were to theirs?&#8221; wrote the <i>Daily
Chronicle</i> on October 29, 1914, and added &#8220;From
accounts that have reached us of the conditions that
prevail at some of our concentration camps, we fear
not.&#8221; Moreover, in these later reports it is difficult
to know the exact meaning of such remarks as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>following, unless we have the earlier reports: &#8220;They
seemed much happier and more contented than at the
time of my former visit....&#8221; (Officers&#8217; Camp,
Holyport). &#8220;There has been no change in the
sleeping accommodations since the last report, but as
the number of the prisoners is much less than it was
at that time, there is much more room....&#8221; (Dorchester.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The general tone of the hospital seemed to be
much happier than at the time of my last visit.&#8221;
(Dartford, Lower Southern Hospital for wounded
prisoners of war.)</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been no change in the sleeping accommodation
since the last visit, except that, owing to
the smaller number of men, there is now more room
than before.... The men seemed much happier and
more contented than at the time of our last visit.&#8221;
(Officers&#8217; camp, Donington Hall.)</p>

<p>The last quotation recalls the once famous charges
as to the excessive luxury of Donington Hall. In
every country the same kind of protest arises as to the
luxurious treatment of prisoners, and this is declared
a scandal in view of the inhuman policy of the enemy.
In every country is to be found the type of patriot who
feels that all is lost if it can be proved that he has
treated an enemy too well. The hubbub about
Donington Hall led to the appointment of a Commons
delegation to visit various camps, and to a report in
the <i>Times</i> (April 26, 1915). In this report the Hall is
described as &#8220;a large, bare house situated in a
hollow.... The style of furnishing was that of a
sergeant&#8217;s mess.&#8221; There was one piano, provided at
the prisoners&#8217; expense. The billiard tables and other
accessories imagined by perfervid patriots vanish into
thin air.</p>

<p>Dyffryn Aled Officers&#8217; camp in North Wales is
described in the same account as &#8220;an inaccessible,
gloomy, mildewed-looking house, with all the windows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>on the front side covered with iron bars. It was previously
used as a private lunatic asylum. The kitchen
seemed about the best room in the house.... There
are no fixed baths, but the officers&#8217; valets carry hot
water from the kitchen for hip baths.&#8221; As regards the
site of Dyffryn Aled it is only fair to quote the U.S.
report: &#8220;The situation of the house, in a romantic
valley among the Welsh mountains, is fine and
healthy.&#8221; But even in April, 1916, the bathing
arrangements remained primitive: &#8220;Each officer has
his tin tub.&#8221; One would certainly not wish to make
any hardship of this, yet it is perhaps as well to recall
the U.S. reports on Friedberg and Crefeld in May and
April, 1915, respectively. &#8220;The room containing the
shower-nozzles would ... do credit to a club or
hotel of the first class.&#8221; (See p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_23">23</a>.) At Crefeld:
&#8220;The bathroom which I saw has a floor space of about
1,500 square feet, one-half of which, drained in the
centre, lies under some 20 shower nozzles. There are
a couple of porcelain tubs in the other half, and in the
centre there is a large stove. Hot and cold water is
available. The British officers were enthusiastic in
their praise of this room.&#8221; (P. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Friendly Thought.</span></h3>

<p>The &#8220;Stobsiad,&#8221; the magazine of the prisoners&#8217;
camp at Stobs, Scotland, contains in its seventeenth
number (Jan., 1918) a friendly thought for the
interned &#8220;enemy&#8221; in Germany. The Y.M.C.A. and
the Friends tell them of the ever-increasing need of the
interned Englishmen for English books. &#8220;Would it
not be possible,&#8221; the paragraph proceeds, &#8220;for our
German readers to place English books that they could
part with at the disposal of the English prisoners of
war, just as here German books have been placed at
our disposal. Dr. Elisabeth Rotten&#8217;s Committee
(Berlin, No. 24, Monbijou-Platz 3) will gladly give
further information. It would give us pleasure if many
of our readers would fulfil this wish.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span class="smcap">Unreliable Complaints.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;There has been some trouble with correspondence,&#8221;
we read (<i>Times</i>, l.c.). The Commandant of
one camp, while censoring a prisoner&#8217;s correspondence,
came across a statement that &#8220;he slept on a
plank bed with a verminous mattress ... the
prisoner admitted that he had written a false statement
in order to induce his friends to send him more
luxuries.&#8221; I am reminded of a report from Zossen
mentioned by the Swiss Red Cross delegate. I quote
from the abstract in the <i>Basler Nachrichten</i>: &#8220;It
appears that there is much correspondence with
sympathetic ink at Zossen. A great deal of iodine,
starch and condensed milk are sent to the prisoners by
their friends. These materials serve for the preparation
of such inks.&#8221; We have heard of the use of
sympathetic ink in this country. Experience suggests
that complaints made by these methods are not to be
relied on. The man who likes to tell a tall story is not
very infrequent, either amongst civilians or soldiers,
and if he can gain notoriety or advantage thereby, the
temptation is considerable. Let these be obtained at
the expense of the enemy, and the temptation is
greater still. Some German girls were being taken
back to Germany. An officer asked a girl what kind
of a time she had in England. &#8220;Oh, dreadful,&#8221; she
replied at first. It was the way to gain kudos. But
generosity came to her rescue, she repented and
corrected herself: &#8220;No, perfectly lovely,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;everyone was good to us.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There are many on
both sides who would not repent, but would make
capital out of their interlocutor&#8217;s ignorance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rumours.</span></h3>

<p>Rumours, of course, still continue. They will continue
as long as passions run high. There was a
rumour of smallpox at Ruhleben. The English Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>of the Camp wrote to say: &#8220;There have been no
cases of smallpox since the camp was started here.&#8221;
There were repeated rumours that parcels were not
delivered. An appeal was made to the Director of the
Press Bureau by C.Q.M.S. J.&nbsp;R. Wheeler of the 2nd
Wilts. Regt., prisoner at G&ouml;ttingen. He pointed out
that these rumours (apparently confirmed by postal
officials) were totally unfounded. &#8220;Parcels arrive
safely, and are issued to men often within a couple of
hours of being received from the Post Office.&#8221; The
same matter is dealt with by U.S. representatives,
but, as the Swiss delegate, Arthur Eugster, remarks,
even neutral reports are in these days distrusted. In
fact, often it is only what seems to confirm the worst
suspicions that is believed. Mr. Wheeler points out
that &#8220;the packing of parcels leaves much to be
desired; in many cases a cake is put in a cardboard
box and lightly wrapped up in brown paper,&#8221; a statement
that is important in view of the common opinion
that British parcels were specially maltreated. The
idea of differential treatment had indeed become an
obsession. An example of the extraordinary nonsense
that is believed is the story that &#8220;on the hospital ship,
Oxfordshire, on March 19, sixty wounded British
soldiers, the majority of them from the Black Watch
and 6th Gordon regiments, were taken out of their
cots to make room for sixty Germans ... and that,
in addition, the Germans were supplied with fresh eggs
and bread, while the British wounded soldiers had
only biscuits.&#8221; All this was the subject of a grave
question in Parliament. The story was, of course,
without foundation, but, according to Mr. Tennant
himself, &#8220;it had obtained widespread credence.&#8221;
Marvellous indeed is the credulity of war-time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prisoner Workers.</span></h3>

<p>How far hatred is due to want of knowledge the
record of prisoner farm workers on this side proves:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>As to the German prisoners, it took both the farmers and
the townspeople in the places where they are quartered, and
from which they are often motored to the farms, some little
time to overcome the widespread prejudice against their
employment. But, after a little acquaintance with them, this
prejudice appears to be dying down.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are one of our mainstays on the farms in West
Sussex,&#8221; Mr. Herbert Padwick, chairman of the West
Sussex War Agricultural Committee, and vice-president of
the Farmers&#8217; Union, told me. &#8220;Some of them,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;are themselves farmers, and the sons of farmers. Their work
looks slow, but in the end, as a rule, we find it very thorough.
They used to say, perhaps chaffingly, they wanted to produce
the best crop we have ever had in England, because they
were sure the Germans would take it. No doubt they
really thought it at one time, but they are not, I think, under
this illusion any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p class="signature"><i>Daily News</i>, Aug. 20, 1918.</p>
</div>

<p>Most of us have heard favourable comments from
farmers and others as to the work of their German
helpers. &#8220;I think they&#8217;ve done jolly well, and they
deserve some encouragement,&#8221; said one man to me.
The idea that all Germans are &#8220;Huns&#8221; vanishes on
personal acquaintance. On the other side prejudices
similarly vanish, and I remember seeing an account of
how a German farmer took his prisoner helpers for a
picnic. Evidently he was allowed considerable freedom
with them. There were German Press protests
against the picnic.</p>

<p>From the <i>Daily News</i> of September 28, 1918, I take
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Here is a &#8220;gleaning&#8221; worth setting beside those which
&#8220;Kuklos&#8221; gave us yesterday. A West-country farmer of
my acquaintance has a brother who is a prisoner in the
hands of the Germans at a place not far from Stettin.
Recently a number of German prisoners were sent to work
on his farm, and among them was a German farmer from
that very place. The German told him that he had English
prisoners on his own fields in the Fatherland, so that quite
possibly this curious exchange may be complete.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, incidentally, that the English
prisoner speaks well of his treatment in Germany. The
German, for his part, assured my friend that while his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>prisoner-hands were not receiving excellent cider, like that
which he himself was now allowed, they had plenty of good
beer during the harvest.</p></div>

<p>I have often thought that a widespread distribution
of prisoner workers throughout each belligerent country
might do more than anything else to allay mutual
misunderstanding. In all wars the tendency is to
regard the enemies as terrible beings, scarcely even
of human shape. To a considerable extent this is due
to the fact that all the horror of war is attributed by
civilians to the enemy. The soldiers of course know
better. But when the civilian finds enemy prisoners
good fellows to work with, he cannot often resist the
proof of our common humanity. A village girl was
telling me lately how the feelings of many had altered
since German prisoners had been in the neighbourhood,
and especially marked had been the effect upon
those who had actually worked with them. &#8220;So
you&#8217;ve changed your mind about them,&#8221; she said to a
friend who worked with prisoners, and the friend had
the courage to answer quite simply: &#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;
If we all have the courage to change our minds, the
peace that comes will be real.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some Other Prisoners.</span></h3>

<p>There is often so much similarity in the complaints
made on both sides that the sufferings would seem to
be very similar. I happened once, in a private hotel,
to get into conversation with some German women
who had been taken prisoner in East Africa. They
were scarcely &#8220;military prisoners,&#8221; but they were
taken prisoner in the ordinary operations of war. With
the women were three children. A young baby was
wizened and pitiable, a little boy of between three and
four had evidently had his whole body covered with
boils or abscesses, a little girl of perhaps five would
have been a charming little creature, but for a large
abscess on her forehead and big swellings under the
eyes. I asked how it was the children were in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>condition. The Belgians, by whom these women were
originally taken prisoner, would not, I was told, supply
any milk for the children. It may be said that the
Belgian officials should be consulted on this point, and
I am well aware that prisoners&#8217; statements need
corroboration. Do we, however, apply this rule in
other cases? Are we careful to investigate newspaper
reports of the statements of prisoners who have been
in German hands, and should we suggest that the
evidence of German officials should also be taken? The
women struck me as singularly quiet, and unhysterical,
and I must add, fair-minded. There were
officials at times, they said, who were more humane,
and provided milk on the quiet. Did they make any
protests, I asked. &#8220;At first we did,&#8221; they
answered, &#8220;but we were always told &#8216;You are
prisoners, and have nothing to say.&#8217;&#8221; The condition
of the children certainly suggested that they had
suffered severely from malnutrition. This may
indeed have been unavoidable, and not the fault of
any one. I had a little further chat with one of the
group, a very quiet woman, whose rather drawn, set
face showed that she had passed through hard times.
It was a little pathetic to me to note how sincerely she
was convinced of the superior virtues of her side. &#8220;In
the earlier days of the war when we had English
prisoners,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they were always well fed, even
though we went short. Our Commandant always
made a point of seeing that they were well provided
for.&#8221; There was in the quiet, rather weary voice just
a gentle shade of reproach, and that was all. I have
not the slightest doubt that the woman was perfectly
sincere. I made only the very obvious remark that it
seemed to me there were good and bad on both sides,
and that some officials behaved well, and some not
well. It was a mistake to generalise and think all was
ill on the other side and all was well on one&#8217;s own.
She saw fairness in this view, I think. There was a
mutual approach, and a growing kindliness. I felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>then, and feel more strongly now, that kindness cannot
grow out of merely aggressive patriotism.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>It seems plain that in France, Germany and Great
Britain there has been an honest, if not always a very
sympathetic attempt to treat prisoners decently. But
we hear little about the condition of prisoners elsewhere.
It is curious to note how, in spite of all the
horror perpetrated repeatedly by Turkish authorities
in times, not of war, but of peace, British feeling is
never very indignant against the Turk; and how
prisoners of war are faring in Turkey we scarcely
know. Not till July, 1917, does there seem to have
been any definite application for the inspection of
Turkish internment camps. On July 18, 1917, an
announcement appeared in the Press to the effect that,
in response to a request from the British Government,
the International Committee of the Red Cross at
Geneva had applied to the Turkish Government for the
necessary permission.</p>

<p>Yet here, as in all war matters, we come upon
&#8220;reprisals.&#8221; The following is a cutting from the
<i>Daily News</i> of July 20, 1917:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Mr. James Hope, for the Foreign Office, stated in the
Commons yesterday that five British officers had been for
over three months imprisoned in Constantinople as a
reprisal for the alleged imprisonment of Turkish officers in
Egypt. The United States Ambassador was requested on
April 25 to explain to the Porte by telegram that only one
of the five Turkish officers in Egypt had been under arrest,
and that for attempted escape. He regretted to say that
one of the five British officers had died. They had just
received a message from the Danish Minister at Constantinople
stating that the four surviving officers returned
to camp on July 4.</p></div>

<p>Statements about <i>enemy</i> reprisals are usually less
frank than this. The neutral observer has usually to
watch each side describing its most drastic actions as
reprisals upon the other for similar deeds.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><span class="smcap">Serbia.</span></h3>

<p>The condition of Austrian and German prisoners in
Serbia has been touched upon by Dr. F.&nbsp;M. Dickinson
Berry, Physician to the Anglo-Serbian Hospital Unit.
I give the following quotations from an article by Dr.
Berry in the <i>Nation</i> of August 21, 1915.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that the prisoners suffered
badly during the winter.... Typhus decimated
them earlier and more universally, probably owing to
the way in which they were crowded together. Outside
the town our prisoner pointed out a cottage
adjacent to a brick-kiln, where he, with 250 men, had
stayed some months without beds, blankets, or even
straw to sleep on, and with the scantiest of food.&#8221;
But the villagers showed kindness, said the prisoner,
and bestowed on them the food placed by Serbian
custom on the graves of the dead. &#8220;Many of the
prisoners fell sick and were taken off to the hospital.
Here, too, they lay on the floor with nothing to cover
them but a great-coat, if the fortunate possessors of
such. Few who entered the hospital ever came back;
if not ill with typhus when they came in, they were
pretty safe to get it there, and they passed on to the
cemetery beyond the town, where, as in so many
Serbian cemeteries, however remotely situated, there
is a portion covered thickly with plain wooden crosses,
marking the graves of Austrian prisoners. Our
informant told us that of those with him 50 per cent.
had died; of eleven Italians whom he had under his
charge one only survived. Asked whether they had
any guards, he said no; each sergeant (he himself was
one) was put in charge of fifty men, and was answerable
with his life in case any should escape.&#8221; There
were, however, some compensations for the primitive
barbarity of these arrangements. The Serbian people
did not attack their prisoners, they fed them. They
might have learned a less human attitude under more
civilised conditions. &#8220;As we motored through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>town we were amused at the number of greetings our
prisoner received; he was evidently a well known and
popular person. As we passed he pointed out the
houses of acquaintances and other objects of interest.
On one side lived a municipal official, who, finding
that he held the same sort of post in Bohemia, greeted
him as a colleague and used to ask him to his house.
Further on was the fountain where he had come to
wash his clothes in the bitter winter weather, and
close by the house of the kind but match-making old
lady who washed his clothes for him, and having a
daughter&#8217;s hand to dispose of, wished to keep him as a
son-in-law.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Russia.</span></h3>

<p>Of what happened in Russian prison camps we have
only rumours, and the usual individual statements.
The old Russian r&eacute;gime was scarcely likely to be very
efficient or very humane in its treatment of prisoners,
but any one who has examined war stories will be
very cautious of believing all that is told. What the
&#8220;unofficial information and rumours&#8221; were may
be sufficiently gathered by referring to the
<i>Cambridge Magazine</i> of August 26, 1916, Supplement
&#8220;Prisoners.&#8221; It may be well to add this: in
November, 1918, Erzberger, interviewed by Dr.
Stollberg, of the <i>Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i>,
asserted that out of 250 thousand prisoners in Russia
only 100 thousand remained alive.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Important Comparison.</span></h3>

<p>It will help to clarify our ideas of charges of ill-treatment
to remind ourselves of the following. A
British officer, Lieut. Gilliland, was put in charge of
the British prisoners of war captured by the
Bulgarians. Mr. MacVeagh brought forward in the
House of Commons various charges made against this
officer by repatriated prisoners. It was said that he
distributed unfairly food and clothing consigned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Irish prisoners, and that he ordered the flogging of
British prisoners by their Bulgarian captors for the
most trivial breaches of discipline. Mr. Macpherson,
for the War Office, said prisoners repatriated from
Bulgaria had made allegations against Lieut. Gilliland
which were entirely opposed to information received
from independent sources, especially from the U.S.
Legation in Sofia, who stated that the officer had done
everything possible for our men. Further inquiry
was promised (<i>Manchester Guardian</i>, November 8,
1917). The charges of the prisoners are in this case
not considered as necessarily true or unbiased. Ought
not similar caution to be observed against whomsoever
the charges may be made?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It is fair to add that the International Red Cross in January, 1915,
visited camps at Holyport, Dyffry, Dorchester, Southend, Portsmouth,
and Queensferry. They did not visit the Isle of Man, where even then
about 4,600 civilians were interned, and they were evidently, if somewhat
innocently, hoping for the release of civilians (First Series, p.&nbsp;25). The
reports are quite satisfactory as far as they go, and the delegates
considered that the prisoners, and especially the military prisoners
(<i>surtout les militaires</i>), were treated well. The feeding is, however,
criticised rather adversely in the case of Portsmouth (both military and
civilian) and at Queensferry (civilian). (<i>La nourriture est elle bien ce
qu&#8217;elle doit &ecirc;tre</i>?) Removal from boats at Southend to <i>terra firma</i> is
recommended. The eternal soup, which seems to have been the lot of
prisoners in all countries, must become fearfully wearisome. The
preserved fish, etc., of later days may become even more trying.</p></div>

CIVILIAN PRISONERS.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Resident Enemy Nationals.</span></h3>


<p>A few extracts from Dr. J.&nbsp;M. Spaight&#8217;s important
work, &#8220;War Rights on Land,&#8221; will be useful as an
introduction to this section. &#8220;Resident enemy
nationals,&#8221; runs Dr. Spaight&#8217;s marginal summary,
&#8220;are not interfered with&#8221; (l.c., p.&nbsp;28). The text
proceeds: &#8220;The treatment of resident enemy nationals
has undergone a great change for the better in modern
times. Ancient theory and practice regarded them as
enemies, individually, and admitted the right to arrest
and imprison them. The last instance of this
rigorous rule being put in force is Napoleon&#8217;s detention
of British subjects who happened to be in France
when war broke out in 1803. Present usage allows
enemy nationals to depart freely, even when they
belong to the armed forces of the other belligerent.&#8221;
The State has the right to detain such subjects, but
usage is against it. Again, &#8220;&#8216;Present usage,&#8217; says
Professor LeFur, &#8216;does not admit of the expulsion <i>en
masse</i> of enemy subjects resident in a belligerent&#8217;s
territory, save when the needs of defence demand
such expulsion....&#8217; The bad precedent set by the
Confederate Government in 1861, when it ordered the
banishment of all alien enemies, has not been followed
in subsequent wars. France and Germany allowed
enemy subjects to continue to reside in their
respective territories during the war of 1870-1, but the
former country was led by military exigencies to
rescind the general privilege so far as Paris and the
Department of the Seine were concerned, at the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>of August, 1870. A Proclamation was then issued by
General Trochu which enjoined &#8216;every person not a
naturalised Frenchman and belonging to one of the
countries at war with France&#8217; to depart within three
days, under penalty of arrest and trial in the event of
disobedience. The incident is instructive as showing
usage [viz., non-interference with resident enemy
nationals] in the making; for though there were
35,000 in Paris alone, and their expulsion was clearly
justifiable as a measure of defence, the general
opinion in Europe was that they were harshly treated,
and a sum of 100 million francs was claimed, as part
of the war indemnity, in respect of the losses they
sustained in being driven out. It shows, as Hall
observed, that public opinion &#8216;was already ripe for the
establishment of a distinct rule allowing such persons
to remain during good behaviour&#8217; (<i>Hall, International
Law</i>, p.&nbsp;392). The usage has been strengthened by
the precedents set in the Russo-Turkish War in
1877-8, the Chino-Japanese War of 1894, and the
Russo-Japanese War, in all of which enemy residents
were suffered to remain.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Origin of General Internment.</span></h3>

<p>How did it come about that this more humane
usage was in the present war departed from? The
average Englishman, I fear, assumes that all the
blame is in this case due to the enemy. The following
correspondence should make the matter clearer.

<p>The decision of His Majesty&#8217;s Government in this respect
being clearly irrevocable, the communications which you
were good enough to transmit did not appear to call for an
immediate reply, although, as your Excellency is aware, the
German Government threatened, and have since carried out,
reprisals against British subjects in Germany.</p>

<p>At the same time, I hope in due course, when the
measures taken here have assumed a definite form, proper
consideration having been given to reasonable claims for
exemption as regards particular categories of persons, to
address your Excellency further on the subject, with a view
of obtaining the release at least of British subjects in Germany
who correspond to those categories.</p>

<p>I may state at once that no Germans over the age of 45 are
being arrested.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>I should, however, be glad if your Excellency would
endeavour to bring home to the German Government that His
Majesty&#8217;s Government are faced with a problem which does
not apply to the same extent in Germany.</p>

<p>There are, roughly, 50,000 Germans resident in this
country, and the presence of such large numbers of the
subjects of a country with whom Great Britain is at war
must necessarily be a cause of anxiety to the military
authorities who are concerned with taking adequate measures
for the defence of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In detaining persons who might, in certain eventualities,
become a source of danger to the State, His Majesty&#8217;s Government
are only acting in accordance with the dictates of a
legitimate and reasonable policy, and they would be clearly
lacking in their duty to the country if they neglected to safeguard
its interests by allowing the continuance of possible
risks to the public safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>In proceeding as they have done they have only had this
one consideration before them, and it has never once been
their intention to indulge in a domestic act of hostility
towards German subjects as such, or in any way to inflict
hardship for hardship&#8217;s sake on innocent civilians.</p>

<p>Every endeavour is being made, as Your Excellency is
aware from Mr. Chandler Anderson&#8217;s report on the concentration
camps, to mitigate the inconvenience to the persons
detained, and to provide the best possible treatment for them
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>As time goes on it is hoped that it will be possible to
improve further the necessarily austere conditions of the
military discipline to which the prisoners are bound to be
subjected, and every endeavour is being made already to
rectify any mistakes that may have occurred, both in the
arrest of persons who should properly be exempt, and in the
r&eacute;gime, which, through its hurried organisation, could not
fail to contain a certain number of defects at the outset....</p></div>

<p>Into the case for and against general internment I
do not propose to enter; it has nothing to do with the
main purpose of this book. It does, however, concern
that purpose to point out first that the general internment
of resident enemy nationals (whatever its
justification in any particular case) is contrary to
modern usage, and second that the order for general
internment was given first not in Germany, but in
Britain. The popular view on this subject is
erroneous. The German order was issued as a
&#8220;reprisal,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but, once issued, it was carried out with
dispatch, a dispatch which was, of course, easier
because of the comparatively small number of British
subjects in Germany.</p>

<p>It will, I think, be useful to quote some further
letters. The first document is an extract from a
telegram received, <i>via</i> Copenhagen, by the U.S.
Embassy in London on November 7, 1914. The
telegram is from the Ambassador (Mr. Gerard) at
Berlin, and conveys the representations of Mr.
Chandler Anderson, of the American Embassy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>London, who was at the moment in Berlin. Anderson
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Tell Foreign Office that there is no compulsory military
service required by German law for men over 45, and any
men over that age serving in the army are volunteers.
Agreement to release all men over 45 would produce better
understanding, refusal is regarded as questioning truth of
their assurances, which were endorsed by our Ambassador.
Would like to settle these matters while here, and want to
leave on Tuesday or Wednesday. Am arranging to have
someone from this Embassy return with me to report, for
information of Foreign Office here, about concentration camp
and reasons for internment of civilians, in order to establish
common basis for their treatment and provisions and clothing
furnished and pay of officers, on the understanding that
accounts will be balanced at close of war or at stated
intervals.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gerard</span>, Berlin.</p>

<p>The following documents deserve careful consideration:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="newletter"><i>Memorandum communicated by American Embassy.</i><br />
November 9, 1914.</p>

<p>The American Embassy has the honour to submit the
following copy of a telegram which the Ambassador at
Berlin has sent to the Department of State at Washington:</p>

<p>&#8220;Order for internment British between 17 and 55 has gone
into effect. This does not apply to clericals, doctors, or
women, or to British subjects from colonies or protectorates
where Germans are not interned. German Government
wishes to receive official information regarding such colonies,
as it understands Germans are interned in South Africa.
Germany is willing to release men over 45 if England will
do so. Germans over 45, except officers, have no compulsory
military obligations.&#8221;</p>

<p>American Embassy, London, Nov. 9, 1914.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="newletter"><i>Memorandum by Sir Edward Grey.</i></p>

<p>The American Ambassador asked me to-day whether the
American Embassy would be allowed, as reports were being
made in Germany about the treatment of German civilians
in England, to send someone to visit the Germans interned
in Newbury and Newcastle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>The Ambassador also said that he had received specific
complaints from Germans interned in Queensferry.</p>

<p>He has given me the following copy of a letter from the
American Ambassador in Berlin.</p>

<p>The object of the Ambassador&#8217;s enquiry is simply, by
bringing out the facts, to prevent false statements from
doing harm in Germany, and at the same time, I assume, to
contribute to the remedying of any grievances that may
exist.</p>

<p>The American Ambassador in Berlin is, I know, doing all
in his power to secure good treatment for British subjects in
Germany, and I think that it would be desirable to let the
American Embassy here have full information as to our
treatment of Germans.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Although it may already be too late to be of much
practical effect, I feel it my duty, in the interest of
humanity, to urge upon you to obtain some formal declaration
on the part of the British Government, as to its purpose
in ordering the wholesale concentration of Germans in Great
Britain and Ireland, as is understood here to be the case.
It is known here that many of the Germans interned belong
to the labouring classes, and that their position is actually
improved by their internment, and it is recognised that the
British Government has the right to arrest persons when any
well-founded ground for suspecting them to be spies exists.
Great popular resentment has been created by the reports of
the arrests of other Germans, however, and the German
authorities cannot explain or understand why German
travellers who have been taken from ocean steamers should
not be permitted to remain at liberty, of course under police
control, even if they are compelled to stay in England. The
order for the general concentration of British males between
the ages of 17 and 55, which went into effect on the 6th
inst., was occasioned by the pressure of public opinion,
which has been still further excited by the newspaper reports
of a considerable number of deaths in concentration camps.
Up to the 6th considerable liberty of movement has been
allowed to British subjects in Germany,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and, as you were
informed in my telegram of the 5th, many petitions were
received from them setting forth the favourable conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>under which they were permitted to live and to carry on
their business, and urging the similar treatment of German
subjects in England. I cannot but feel that to a great extent
the English action and the German retaliation has been caused
by a misunderstanding which we should do our best to
remove. It seems to me that we should do all in our power
to prevent an increase of the bitterness which seems to have
arisen between the German and English peoples, and to make
it possible for the two countries to become friends on the
close of the war.</p>

<p class="newletter"><i>Mr. Harris to Mr. Gerard</i>.</p>
<p class="right20">Frankfort-on-Main,</p>
<p class="date">November 9, 1914.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In a letter of the same date as this I have referred
to the return from Giessen of four officers sent to Giessen,
and returned again to Frankfort and to Nauheim, from which
they came. I referred in this letter to the commander of
the XVIIIth. Army Corps here. The commando is in
charge of Excellenz de Graaf, who has, as he tells me, an
American wife, and who through the past few months has
shown this consulate all possible consideration, as it seems to
Mr. Ives and myself. Twice during the great press of the
first few weeks of the war, he came to the office in person
and made known his desire to assist us in any way possible.
Both Mr. Ives and myself have had occasion to go to the
commando many times on various errands, and in nearly
every case we have been granted the things we desired. It
would be difficult to find a man at home or abroad with a
more pleasant manner than de Graaf&#8217;s, or who shows less of
the harsh or severe. Many of the English have gone to him,
and they in all cases, so far as I have heard, speak in highest
terms as to the way he has received them, and as to the
entire freedom given them in this city until the order of last
Friday.</p>

<p>I have gone into the matter just a little because of a
vicious and, I think, wholly unwarranted attack in the
papers, in which Mr. George Edwardes, of London, is made
to say quite improbable things as coming from de Graaf, and
perhaps made our work just a little more difficult. Whether
this be the case or not, I am sure you will be glad to know
that the commander here has given ample evidence of desire
to meet Mr. Ives and myself in every request we have had
to make of him.</p>

<p class="right25">I have, etc.,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>The &#8220;entire freedom&#8221; allowed to English in
Frankfort until the reprisal order was made out is a
fact that should be emphasised. It bears out the idea
that it was British action which brought about the
general internment order in Germany. Moreover, the
reports as to ill-treatment and deaths produced the
same kind of effect on the other side as they did on
this. Of course, there were grave hardships on both
sides, and, indeed, Sir Edward Grey allowed (vide
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_79">79</a>) that &#8220;the r&eacute;gime ... through its hurried
organisation, could not fail to contain a certain
number of defects at the outset.&#8221;</p>

<p>The r&eacute;gime, like some other steps taken in this war,
was too hurriedly arranged in response to newspaper
agitation. The <i>Cologne Gazette</i>, complaining that
Germans are treated like pariahs in England, asks if
Englishmen in Germany are &#8220;to enjoy for ever a life
of gods unmolested.&#8221; (<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, October 29,
1914.) The old demand for &#8220;reprisals,&#8221; leading to
counter-reprisals and a crescendo of cruelty.</p>

<p>In Austria no general internment order was made.
The <i>Daily Chronicle</i> correspondent, writing in
January, 1915, from Vienna, spoke of the freedom of
all foreigners there, even when the subjects of enemy
Governments. All such subjects, his host reminded
him, &#8220;enjoy full, or nearly full liberty, whereas in
Great Britain and France Austro-German subjects have
either been clapped into prison, or at any rate confined
in a camp or barracks.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Civilian and Military Prisoners Compared.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;Confinement in a camp or barracks&#8221; sounds a
small thing. It is really, wherever it occurs, a rather
terrible thing. The universal experience is that
civilians suffer under this restraint more than soldiers,
and consequently are more &#8220;difficult&#8221; to deal with.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>There are, I think, various fairly obvious reasons for
this difference. To the soldier the prison camp is an
escape from worse horrors, the soldier is inured to a
large measure of monotony, he is also inured to
military control and certain peculiarities of the
military manner. To the civilian the prison camp is
a change from freedom to confinement, from comfort
to hardship, often from prosperity to ruin. The
civilian&#8217;s life has been one of varied activities, and
becomes one of almost unrelieved monotony. He is
in most cases quite unused to military control, and
feels himself degraded to a kind of servitude. Used
to a separate and individual life, he is forced into
contact, day and night, with others not of his own
choice, and often antipathetic to him. He finds himself
deprived of every vestige of privacy, and his
thoughts revolve often round chances gone, work lost,
hopes vanished, a wife living in penury, and a future
altogether dark. If anyone will try to picture such
a life continued not for weeks or months only, but for
<i>years</i>, he will, I think, feel that hysteria, loss of
mental balance and actual insanity are consequences
that are only too likely to follow.</p>

<p>Civilian control for civilian prisoners seems in
general to be desirable. Military control was practically
withdrawn from Ruhleben in the autumn of
1915. At a few camps here, such as the one at
Cornwallis Road, it is practically absent, and I feel
this is one reason why, writing in March, 1916, the
U.S. Attach&eacute; was able to report that there had at this
camp been no attempts at escape.</p>

<p>There was much that was harsh and bad in the
earlier days of internment in Germany, but the official
U.S. reports certainly make us aware of cordial
German co-operation in improving matters. The
unofficial account, moreover, of Dr. Cimino (&#8220;Behind
the Prison Bars in Germany&#8221;) astonishes me chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>by the amount of politeness which it reveals in the
German official.</p>

<p>There will always be stupid officials, and complete
military authority is a very dangerous thing. This
obvious conclusion should be recognised as applying
(to some extent at least) to both sides. It is a rather
dreadful thing to be under more or less hostile restraint,
whether one be German or British. &#8220;Even if ideal
conditions prevailed, one could not remove the unavoidable
feeling of restraint and the sorrow of separation
of men from their wives and families. There is in all
the camps a feeling of gloom which one visitor said
&#8216;haunted him for days.&#8217; It is scarcely surprising that
feelings of resentment should arise. Many of the men
have lived in this country for twenty or thirty years;
some have come over here as young children, some are
even unable to speak German; very many have married
British wives and have come to regard themselves as
citizens of this country. The visit of someone who is
not in authority over them, but who will listen to their
troubles and give them a kind word of encouragement,
has done very much to lighten the bitterness of
confinement.&#8221; So write the Emergency Committee in
their second report on their work for the assistance of
Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in distress. Dr.
Siegmund Schulze, who has worked for a similar
organisation in Berlin, writes: &#8220;It appears that those
who have recently expressed their opinion in the
British Parliament have taken the complaints of a few
dissatisfied prisoners as a basis for their general
opinion. We can quite understand these complaints,
because we notice among all prisoners that the longer
the imprisonment lasts, the greater is the feeling of
dissatisfaction.... It is noteworthy that in the
English utterance even the trustworthiness of neutral
reports is doubted; for example, the statements of the
American Ambassador are regarded as pro-German,
therefore distorted. Frl. Dr. Rotten and I have heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>a great number of neutral opinions on the prisoners
camps; I have myself discussed the conditions of the
detention camp with neutrals who have visited them,
and ascertained the truth as to their reports. Our
verdict can only be that there is absolutely no question
of any conditions which would constitute an infringement
of international law, or which could imperil the
health of the soldiers.... Moreover, I have in
Ruhleben formed my own opinion as to the condition
of the prisoners. I acknowledge that the depressed
state of mind in which the prisoners must naturally be
after more than six months&#8217; imprisonment has an
effect upon their reports, and that many prisoners are
in a state of suppressed rage. On the other hand I
cannot but say that after the removal of certain
insanitary conditions there have been absolutely no
substantial complaints made by the prisoners. Much
as I regret the position of the prisoners, among whom
I have many personal acquaintances, I must, on the
other hand, say that the accommodation and also the
behaviour of the officers is, on the whole, as humane
as possible under the difficult conditions. The
American Attach&eacute;, Mr. Jackson, who formerly visited
the detention camps in England, and has now again
visited the German detention camps, has confirmed to
me the assertion which he made to the Commandant
of the Ruhleben Camp, viz., that if he were obliged
to choose where, among the countries now at war, he
would be interned, he would certainly choose
Ruhleben.... Without doubt, as is now apparent
everywhere, an imprisonment extending over a long
period, say, for instance, a year, means far more for
men of the present generation than one could have
thought. I consider it possible that many prisoners
who are detained for such a long time will return to
their homes with an essential deterioration of their
mental condition.&#8221; These last are very grave, and
indeed terrible words, words that I fear only too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>accurately represent the facts, but yet, as Dr. Schulze
continues, &#8220;We ought not to conclude from this that
we are justified in making reproaches against the other
country in respect of the treatment of prisoners, but
rather conclude that we should work energetically
towards the termination of the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mental suffering (<i>stagnant</i> suffering) caused to
civilian prisoners (in Britain, as elsewhere) is, I fear,
very far from being understood. The following few
sentences may give some glimpses&mdash;I was going to say
&#8220;enlightening glimpses,&#8221; but, alas, they are only
glimpses into the darkness: &#8220;Our visitors in talking
to the men in the camps receive from them many
kinds of requests; of these by far the most frequent and
urgent is that their wives and families may be visited.
For one reason or another, letters from home very
frequently do not reach the prisoners, and often for
weeks or months together they receive no word of their
families.&#8221; The report goes on: &#8220;One man&#8217;s wife was
at the point of death when he left her and her young
children; another&#8217;s wife with several children was
addicted to drink, and was only kept from it by her
husband&#8217;s influence; in other cases children were left
behind with no mother to care for them.&#8221; (The
quotations are from the second report of the Friends&#8217;
Emergency Committee, January, 1915.) To imagine
the anguish of these cases, whether in Germany or in
Britain, is to shrink as from a blow. Many will feel
that the policy of general internment was unavoidable.
But we may surely show generous sympathy where an
unavoidable policy has brought great misery upon
thousands who were innocent. Such sympathy, as we
shall see later, always assists reciprocal sympathy on
the other side.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some Reports on Ruhleben.</span></h3>

<p>I will now turn to the consideration of reports on
individual camps for civilians. The most important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>German civilian camp, of course, for us, is that of
Ruhleben. If I cite a Report on the Meeting of the
Camp Committee held there on February 4, 1915, a
good deal as to the general management of the camp
will become plain. [Miscel. No. 7 (1915) p.&nbsp;67.]</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The following minutes of a meeting of the select committee
of the camp committee and of the overseers,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which was
called by Baron von Taube on February 2, were read by the
Secretary:</p>

<p>At 6-30 p.m., Baron von Taube received a select committee
of the camp committee in the presence of the
assembled overseers of the latter. Messrs. Powell, Fischer,
Jones, Blakely, Cocker, Overweg, Asher, Hallam, Russel,
Aman, and Jones were present; also<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Messrs. Delmer,
Butcher, Stern, Scholl, Mackenzie, Horn, Klingender,
Butterworth, and Hatfield.</p>

<p>Having greeted the assembled members, the Baron proceeded
to say that he thought it would be best if only three
or four delegates from the camp committee were to discuss
matters directly with the overseers. He expressed his views
and compared the management of the camp with the administration
of a town of 10,000 inhabitants. Too many participants
might only render the work of the overseers more
arduous. He therefore suggested that at the meetings of
the overseers, the select committee of the camp committee
should consist of from three to four gentlemen with deciding
votes. The suggestion was accepted. Thereupon the Baron
informed the meeting that Messrs. Butcher, Klingender, and
Stern had been proposed. In reply to this, Mr. Delmer,
chairman of the camp committee, said that from among the
eight men whose names had been submitted, three or four
should from time to time be chosen as delegates according to
their special knowledge and the business to be transacted.
After a short discussion it was agreed, upon the proposal of
Mr. Powell, that three or four gentlemen should, as delegates
from the camp committee, take part in a general
meeting of overseers to be held once a fortnight. At these
meetings a strict account of the work of the overseers during
the interval should be rendered. On the proposal of the chairman,
Mr. Delmer, it was further agreed that delegates
of the camp committee should have the right at all times to
require the overseers to furnish explanations of any incidents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>affecting the interests of the camp. A motion of the chairman,
which was also approved by the Baron, was to the
effect that, in order to spare the overseers&#8217; committee time
and trouble, any incidents occurring in the camp should be
thoroughly sifted and investigated by the camp committee,
and then reported to the administration as soon as possible
by a single competent deputy through the overseers.</p>

<p>The presiding overseer welcomed a further motion by the
chairman, Mr. Delmer, which was as follows: In the
interests of the necessary reciprocity, a delegate of the
overseers should attend the meetings of the camp committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Klingender drew attention to the two points contained
in the camp committee&#8217;s letter to Baron von Taube. The
Baron said he agreed with the contents of the letter.</p>

<p>At the conclusion the chairman (Mr. Delmer) remarked
that the camp committee had been formed with a view to
beneficial co-operation with the overseers, and for the
advancement of the existing organisation, and that it
intended loyally to carry out this principle, of which words
the Baron graciously took note. The chairman (Mr. Delmer)
then expressed his hearty thanks in the name of the
assembled members of the camp committee to the Baron for
his presence and for the consideration he had kindly given
to the arrangement, whereupon the Baron said that he would
be very pleased personally from time to time to take part
in the meetings of the camp committee.</p>

<p>Baron von Taube then closed the meeting.</p>

<p>The secretary announced that he had laid a copy of the
minutes before the Baron, who had kindly accepted and
signed it, and had, with his own hand, written on it the
words, &#8220;Have taken note of the minutes and agree on all
points.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chairman greeted Mr. Fischer, overseer of hut 3,
who was present as delegate of the overseers. The meeting
proceeded to discuss the following matters:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Latrines for Invalids.</span>&mdash;At the last meeting the camp
committee had requested a member to procure information
on this matter. Mr. Fischer reported that the small latrine
between huts 3 and 4 (which was formerly intended for
women) should be used for this purpose. A door with a
lock would be put in. Permits would probably be issued by
the doctor or his representative. The overseers had for a
long time striven to obtain permission for the sick to use the
water closets, but these for the most part were not in the
premises which were at the disposal of the military authorities,
and therefore could not, even on payment, be opened.
He would again inquire if it were not possible to obtain a
closed water closet for the sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><span class="smcap">Postal Matters.</span>&mdash;Questions concerning the postal regulations
and the censoring of letters were brought up. A
member expressed his intention of obtaining precise information
and of reporting thereon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outbreak of Diarrh&#339;a.</span>&mdash;It was announced that 78 cases
had occurred at hut 1.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Mr. Fischer was asked whether the
number of cases in each hut was known to the overseers.
He replied that they had furnished a report on the previous
day. It was suggested that in such a case the overseers
might with advantage seek the assistance of the delegates
of the camp committee, and especially in the present case,
as the overseers were much occupied with other work, and
could not collect complete statistics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bread.</span>&mdash;The question of the quality of the bread was
raised; it was alleged that bread insufficiently baked and
bread which consisted of remains insufficiently ground
together was sometimes distributed. As 2,000 of the prisoners
were penniless, the question was one of great importance.
Mr. Fischer said that bread of inferior quality, if returned
immediately, would be exchanged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Youths Under 17 Years of Age.</span>&mdash;It was alleged that
not all the prisoners under 17 years of age had yet taken
the necessary steps to obtain their release. The meeting,
however, thought that it was the presence of young sailors,
for whose release repeated application had been made, that
had produced this impression. These sailors, however, were
in quite a different position from the civilian prisoners.
Civilian prisoners under 17 were released. The overseers
had the matter under consideration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washing.</span>&mdash;Mr. Whitwell had taken cast-off clothing from
the rubbish-box. He had had them washed, and found that
they were still serviceable. In his opinion, the whole of the
camp washing could be done by two machines costing about
60M. each. Mr. Fischer observed that the overseers had given
this matter their attention, but that great difficulties would
arise if any proposals adverse to the concessions granted by
the military authority to private concerns were to be made.</p>

<p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p></div>

<p>We may next cite an unofficial statement:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Statement Respecting Conditions at Ruhleben Communicated
to Home Office by two Released Civilians on
March 18, 1915.</span></p>

<p>Mr. John P. Bradshaw, of Ballymoney, co. Antrim, and
Mr. William David Coyne, of Ballyhaunis, co. Mayo, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>British subjects, arrived in England on the March 15,
having just been released from detention at Ruhleben on
account of their unfitness for military service.</p>

<p>The following statement has been made by them to the
Home Office:</p>

<p>They were examined by the Camp Doctor, and released
as unfit for military service.</p>

<p>A fortnight ago all who considered themselves unfit were
invited to send their names in with a statement of the
grounds of unfitness.</p>

<p>A week later all were asked to state where they would
go if released from Ruhleben, but few of the real British
subjects were anxious to be released now unless they can
leave Germany because of the bitterness against England.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Since March 7 a very important change has taken place
in the food supply to the prisoners; thanks to investigations
by Rittmeister von M&uuml;ller, the caterer has been dispensed
with. It is believed in the camp that the United States
authorities prompted these investigations.</p>

<p>The German authorities provide bread which is of better
quality than formerly. The allowance is over half a pound
per man per day, i.e., more than the civilian population is
allowed, but it is believed that a regulation has been made,
though not yet brought into force, to reduce the bread allowance
to correspond with that allowed to persons outside the
camp. Bread is no longer purchaseable at the canteen.</p>

<p>The Government allows 60 pfennige (just over 7d.) per
head for the rest of the food. The canteen committee buys
100 grammes of meat (gristle, bone, etc., included) per man
per day. Pork is much used, then comes mutton, and, more
rarely, beef.</p>

<p>The meat is cooked in the soup and each man is given a
piece about the size of a cutlet with his soup at midday. The
spare pieces are divided amongst the men from the last
barracks to be served; the barracks take it in turn to be last.</p>

<p>On one day a week dinner consists of a piece of sausage
and rice and prunes.</p>

<p>A piece of sausage is now served with the evening tea
or coffee. This sausage is bought out of the savings under
the new system.</p>

<p>The rest of the savings on the catering and the profit on
the sales at the canteen go towards providing clothes, etc., for
the poorest men in the camp.</p>

<p>The meat is inspected by two of the prisoners, one a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>veterinary surgeon and the other a butcher; it is cooked by
ships&#8217; cooks who are interned, and served by men chosen
from among the prisoners. The food is said to be well
cooked and the meals quite appetising, at any rate when compared
with the previous r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>The two men named above received all parcels sent to
them. Formerly parcels took about four weeks to reach
the camp from England, but now they arrive in ten to twelve
days.</p>

<p>The officials are scrupulously honest as regards money
owned by or sent to the prisoners, except that they pay out
in paper or silver, whereas they took in gold. Money is
paid out to those prisoners who have an account at the rate
of 20M. per fortnight, but an extra 20M. can be obtained
for the purchase of boots, clothes, etc., if shown to be necessary.</p>

<p>The correspondence regulations are now that one postcard
with nine lines of writing may be sent each week, and two
letters, each of four pages of notepaper may be sent per
month. In addition, business letters may be sent to any
reasonable extent.</p>

<p>A dramatic society has been started and recently gave its
first performance, Shaw&#8217;s &#8220;Androcles and the Lion.&#8221;
Admission was free, but seats cost from 20 to 40 pfennigs,
not according to the position of the seat, but according to
the means of the purchaser.</p>

<p>Baron von Taube and Graf von Schwerin make a point of
being present at all entertainments organised by the prisoners,
and make a short speech of thanks at the end. Since the
trouble over the food has been settled the relations between
the officials and the prisoners have greatly improved.</p>

<p>A month ago all British colonial subjects were re-arrested
and interned. [Miscel. No. 7. (1915). P. 81.]</p></div>

he has received from the Embassy at Berlin, dated the 8th

conditions at present existing in the British civil internment

<p class="newletter"><span class="smcap">Enclosure 2.</span><br />
<i>Mr. Minot to Mr. Gerard.</i></p>

<p class="date">June 3, 1915.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to submit to you the following
report upon various improvements which have taken place
in the civil internment camp for British prisoners at
Ruhleben-bei-Spandau since the month of November, 1914:</p>

<p>Of the 4,500 British civil prisoners interned in Germany,
approximately 4,000 are at this date held at Ruhleben, the
remaining 500 being scattered in small detachments in various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>other internment camps. The German Government have
arranged that these detachments shall be absorbed by Ruhleben,
so that within a few months all the British civil
prisoners interned in Germany will be in Ruhleben. The
difficulty of enlarging the facilities of Ruhleben and the
necessary precautionary measures of quarantining have made
the process of combination a long one, but there is every
reason to believe that it will soon be completed.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of prisoners at Ruhleben has
necessitated substantial additions to the barracks, most of
which were overcrowded at the beginning of the war. Eight
new barracks of one storey have been erected (four being
already occupied), affording accommodation for 120 men each.
These barracks are substantially built of wood, with well-set
floors and large windows. The roofs have been waterproofed
with tarred paper, and the walls stained to resist the rain.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
In the four new barracks which are now occupied a small
room for the guard has been added, but in the new barracks
this has been considered unnecessary, as it is hoped that the
guards in the barracks at night may shortly be dispensed
with. The last new barracks has been built with a special
view towards housing convalescent or delicate persons. Partitions
have been erected so as to cut up the barrack into
small divisions, and two water-closets have been installed.
A new washhouse for these barracks has been erected, with
shower baths and washing troughs.</p>

<p>The construction of the new barracks, the transfer of some
hundred persons to Dr. Weiler&#8217;s sanatorium, and the release
of about a hundred persons have made it possible largely to
reduce the crowded conditions of the &#8220;obens,&#8221; or lofts, of
the old barracks. Twenty per cent. of the occupants of
these &#8220;obens&#8221; have been removed, and it is estimated that
when the new barracks are fully occupied another 55 per
cent. will be removed from the obens, so that only a quarter
of the original occupants will be left there.</p>

<p>The most signal improvement which has been effected in
the last two months has been the permission afforded the
prisoners to use the ground encircled by the race-track for
the hours from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.
The space thus gained is approximately 200 yards by 150
yards, and affords a splendid field for all kinds of games.
Materials for the various sports have been provided by the
camp, including the laying out of a football field and a small
golf course. This ground has provided a chance for every
interned prisoner to take part in some form of good out-of-door
exercise or for those who so desire to move out their chairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>to the field to watch the games. Permission to use the grandstands
from 8 a.m. to 8-30 p.m. has further been obtained.
As the stands are of modern brick and cement construction,
a large enclosed hall is formed underneath the tiers of seats.
In this hall a stage has been erected and a complete theatre
installed with scenery, dressing-rooms, orchestra, etc. Performances,
varying from Shakespeare to musical shows, are
given practically every night. The betting boxes have been
boarded up to afford small rooms for study, musical practice,
etc. In other parts of this building space has been allotted
for a carpenter&#8217;s shop, a tailor&#8217;s shop, barber and cobbler&#8217;s
shop. The grandstand tiers have been turned over to the
educational department for schools and lectures, which are
systematically conducted. Black-boards and other materials
have been provided for the department.</p></div>

<p>A favourable account of Dr. Weiler&#8217;s sanatorium
follows. About this sanatorium individual expressions
of opinion have varied.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot&#8217;s report next gives a list of improvements
effected at Ruhleben, under such headings as <i>Laundry,
Whitewashing, Beds, Dentist, Business Post</i>, etc. The
report then proceeds:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>It can be seen from the above that very considerable
improvements have been effected at Ruhleben. Graf
Schwerin, Baron Taube, and the other camp authorities have
done everything in their power to bring about these improvements,
and have been materially helped throughout by the
camp captains.</p>

<p>The effect produced has been a general improvement in
the physical and moral condition of the camp. In general
the health of the prisoners can be said to be excellent, practically
no cases of contagious or infectious diseases, barring
a mild epidemic of German measles, having occurred. The
improvement in the food and the increased possibilities of
the purchase of additional nourishment from the outside,
have nearly silenced all complaints.</p>

<p>The work is still constantly progressing, and it is fair to
state that the conditions are steadily, if slowly, improving.</p>

<p>I am submitting to you, herewith, a plan of Ruhleben,
upon which are marked the various buildings and locations
mentioned in this report. I have further included a selection
of programmes of the various entertainments, sports,
etc., which have taken place in the camp.&mdash;I have, etc.,</p>

significance. The first is from the <i>Times</i>, the second
is from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of June 18, 1915. The
suspension of correspondence was due to some
demonstration on the part of the prisoners.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Sir,&mdash;It may perhaps interest some of those who are feeling
anxious about the treatment of their relatives at Ruhleben
to hear that we have direct evidence of kindly action and consideration
for the prisoners on the part of the German authorities

was suspended.&mdash;I am faithfully yours,</p>

</div>


<div class="blockquote">
<p>We received the following from the Press Bureau last
night:</p>

<p>&#8220;A statement recently appeared in a letter to an organ
of the Press to the effect that it was inadvisable to send
parcels to civilian prisoners interned at Ruhleben in view
of the heavy charges made on delivery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Information has now been received from the United
States Ambassador at Berlin that no such charges have been
made for the delivery of parcels at Ruhleben, but for a short
time certain prisoners who had been temporarily
released and sent to a sanatorium were charged duty
on parcels sent to them there. This matter was, however,
satisfactorily adjusted in a very short time, and duty is no
longer charged on parcels to such prisoners.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In the early autumn of 1915 civilian self-government
was fully established at Ruhleben. Writing on October
16, Mr. Page remarks: &#8220;The administration of the
camp to-day is entirely in the hands of the prisoners
themselves. There are no guards in the barracks, and
all internal arrangements, including discipline, are in
the hands of the camp and barrack captains.&#8221;
[Miscel. No. 3 (1916), p.&nbsp;4.]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Controversy.</span></h3>

<p>White Paper Miscel. No. 3 (1916) is in many ways
rather important to the student of internment. It
affords some evidence of the kind of mental friction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>developing in all internment camps, and it makes clear
that prisoners&#8217; statements often need to be subjected
to impartial outside investigation. There is not space,
however, to enter fully into details here. The paper
opens with a report on Ruhleben camp &#8220;compiled by
a British subject recently released,&#8221; and forwarded by
Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Gerard through Mr. Page. It
is complained that the distance from the new barracks
to the wash-houses is &#8220;in some cases over 200 yards.&#8221;
Mr. Page points out by reference to a scale map that
&#8220;in every case the wash-houses are nearer than 60
yards from the barracks, and not at a distance of 200
yards, as stated. The barracks which are not
diagrammed on this map have their own washing
appliances.&#8221; Mr. Page writes further: &#8220;The open
space beneath the central tribune has not been, as
stated in the report transmitted by the British Foreign
Office, used for every conceivable purpose, but has
been enclosed entirely for recreation purposes,
religious services, lectures, debates, etc.... I
cannot see how the introduction of [the] cinema show
has in the least affected the comfort of the hall.&#8221;
&#8220;With regard to whitewashing, this was done in all of
the barracks at the expense of the camp fund, and not,
as stated, at the cost of those interned at the barracks.
Extra whitewashing, borders, etc., were naturally paid
for at the private expense. No measures were taken
for exterminating mosquitoes for the reason that it has
been found impossible to procure petroleum in
Germany for the purpose.&#8221; Three internees who tried
to escape were in consequence imprisoned, and are
stated in the report transmitted by the British Foreign
Office to be starving. Mr. Gerard writes: &#8220;I visited
Messrs. Ettlinger, Ellison and Kirkpatrick at the
Stadtvogtei-Gef&auml;ngnis about three weeks ago, and
heard from them that they had no complaint to make
about the food. They are now allowed to receive parcels
and money from the outside, and are no longer in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>solitary confinement. The limitation of exercise to
half an hour seems regrettable, but owing to their
attempt to escape, I fear that it will be impossible to
obtain a change until their sentence expires.&#8221;</p>

<p>The report forwarded to Mr. Gerard says:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>It would be of material benefit to the interned if a representative
of the United States Embassy could call at the Camp
fortnightly, and receive complaints direct from prisoners,
without the inevitable presence of the captains [i.e., the
internees&#8217; own captains] in the room.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Gerard replies:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A representative of this Embassy has visited the camp
at Ruhleben (with the exception of the time when the camp
was first formed) certainly on an average of more than once
a fortnight, and it has been possible for any prisoners to
speak to him without the presence of the captains. For the
past few months the camp has been visited once a week if
not more often. In addition to this Mr. Powell, sometimes
accompanied by other captains of the camp, has visited this
Embassy regularly once a week for consultation with me.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;I wish again to reiterate,&#8221; says Mr. Page, &#8220;that
Count Schwerin, Baron Taube and the other officers
in charge of the camp, are all kindly and considerate
gentlemen, who do everything within their power to
help the prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the real quarrel was not with Count Schwerin
or Baron Taube (of whom all seem to speak well), but
with the English captains and their management.
The financial statements and the distributions effected
by the captains are adversely criticised by the released
British subject. He adds, somewhat acidly:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>It would be a kindness to the captains and to the camp
if the Government could convey to them a message informing
them that they are public men holding important and
responsible positions, and that public men must allow criticism
and seek to profit by it.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Here we get to the root of the matter. The original
&#8220;Camp Committee&#8221; was (to quote Mr. Gerard&#8217;s
words) &#8220;disbanded by the order of the military
authorities in February last (1915), because of its
refusal to co-operate with the captains and its insistence
upon publishing notices and minutes of its
meetings after it had been forbidden to do so.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This
&#8220;Camp Committee&#8221; continued to object to the
financial arrangement and the general administration
of Mr. Powell and the other captains, and pressed
their objections upon the Ambassador on August 23,
1915. &#8220;I thereupon suggested that perhaps the best
way would be to refer the matter to a general election.
To this the &#8216;Camp Committee&#8217; demurred, and upon
my asking what suggestion they had to proffer
appeared to consider that they, a self-constituted body,
should be given charge of the camp by me. This
proposition I naturally rejected, especially as the
members of this self-appointed committee were,
although very estimable gentlemen, <i>person&aelig; non
grat&aelig;</i> both to the majority of the prisoners and to the
military authorities.... A final decision of the
question as to whether the present government of
Ruhleben is representative or not is to be found in the
election of September 15, 1915, when every one of the
captains at that time in authority was re-elected. The
occasion was caused by the decision of the military
authorities to withdraw the soldiers from the camp,
and the captains therefore considered it desirable that
they should appeal to the camp for decision as to
whether it was wished that they should continue
the government or not. I cannot see that any further
proof is required as to whether the captains represent
the feelings of the majority of the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>One cannot help asking oneself, was the critic a
member of the disbanded &#8220;Camp Committee&#8221;? The
United States Ambassador on more than one occasion
proved himself capable of speaking very decidedly to
the German authorities of things he disapproved of.
In this case, too, he speaks (though not to the German
authorities) with some decision:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A properly heated and lighted recreation and assembling
room is certainly extremely desirable for the damp and cold
winter time. A new barrack has been sanctioned by the
military authorities for the purpose, and I will do my best
to press the work. I might venture to suggest that if so
many private individuals had not occupied necessary space by
election of private clubs the military authorities would be
more willing to grant permission for the erection of further
buildings intended for public good. Further, if the very
men, such as the &#8220;camp committee&#8221; (who are all members of
the &#8220;summer house&#8221; club), had devoted some of the energies
which they expended upon the erection of the club for their
own private use to the construction of a public sitting-room,
the building might already be in use.</p>

<p>The British tax-payer is paying a large sum in wages
because the Ruhleben prisoners are unwilling to do the
fatigue work of the camp. The captured British soldiers who
have been fighting in the trenches are compelled to do work in
work camps, are often not properly clothed, do not receive
an allowance from the British tax-payer of 5M. a week,
cannot buy food at less than cost price, nor go to a sanatorium
(at the expense of the British tax-payer) when sick;
have not the benefit of expert dental and optical treatment,
have no public libraries, lectures, schools, debates, or camp
newspapers, have not seven tennis courts, three football fields,
athletic games, cricket, golf and hockey, are not amused by
dramas, comic operas and cinema shows, and above all are
not paid extra wages for doing their own work to make
themselves comfortable. All of these advantages and more
which the Ruhleben prisoners enjoy have been largely the
result of the effort of the camp administration which this
commentator criticises.</p></div>

<p>These rather strong words of Mr. Gerard&#8217;s display a
not unnatural irritation against a critic whose facts
prove unreliable and whose mental attitude suggests a
somewhat querulous bias, but it is only fair to remind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ourselves that after long internment all suffer from
nerve strain and many suffer very severely. Under
these circumstances complete reasonableness is
probably more than any of us would be capable of.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Short Rations.</span></h3>

<p>At Ruhleben there are (with the exception of some
negroes) English only. The English receive many
packages. The German authorities have been tempted
to rely on those packages increasingly. That is the
state of things revealed in Dr. A.&nbsp;E. Taylor&#8217;s report
of June 14, 1916. [Miscel. No. 21 (1916).]</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>A review of the present ration of the prisoners of war
indicates that it is the aim of the &#8216;Kriegsern&auml;hrungsamt&#8217; to
supply a ration which shall be physiologically adequate,
though professedly containing little more than enough to cover
minimal requirements; and it is believed that the official
prisoners&#8217; ration contains as much as the daily food of many
millions of German subjects. There is no question that the
official prison ration is an adequate ration from the standpoint
of animal nutrition. In addition to this allotted camp
ration the prisoners possess the food sent in from abroad as
addenda.</p>

<p>In the case of the Russian prisoners, these extra food
stuffs sent in from abroad are small in amount; in the case
of the French, moderate; in the case of the English, large.
In all the prison camps that I have visited it is the practice
to prepare food for the number of men in the camp, irrespective
of nationality, in accordance with the menu of Professor
Backhaus. As a rule, the British prisoners take little or none
of the food, and their share is eaten by prisoners of other
nationalities. In Ruhleben the state of affairs at present
existing has convinced the interned civilians that the situation
is, so to speak, reversed: that the German authorities
seem to regard the foodstuffs sent in from abroad as the
regular diet of the interned men, and the camp allotments as
the addenda.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not surprising that &#8220;the interned men are
deeply dissatisfied with the present state of affairs.&#8221;
The German authorities, finding that at least half the
total number of the interned at Ruhleben subsist
largely upon private packages, have made a &#8220;sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>reduction in the amount of foodstuff allotted to the
camp.&#8221; I have no wish to defend this proceeding, but
it must be allowed that to the Government of a
blockaded country there is a great temptation to cut
down supplies when this will not be a danger to the
prisoners themselves.</p>

<p>Both reports of Dr. Taylor [Miscel. No. 18 (1916)
and Miscel. No. 21 (1916)] are important studies of
the question of nutrition, and his short discussion (No.
18, p.&nbsp;4) of the psychological aspects of monotonous
diet and the nutritional effects of internment is worth
careful attention. &#8220;A diet that would be tolerated if
the subject were at liberty may become intolerable
under conditions of imprisonment. There is a large
personal equation operative in this direction. The
soldier imbued with a high sense of his value to his
country and of the justice of his cause will endure a
monotonous diet that would not be endurable in
the prisoner overwhelmed with disappointment and
crushed with sorrow.&#8221; These considerations are
obviously of general application.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some Comparisons.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Gerard, in a note of June 28, 1916 [Miscel. No.
25 (1916)], animadverts strongly on the bad accommodation
still provided at Ruhleben. The letter is
rather strikingly different in tone from his other reports
on Ruhleben.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>It is intolerable that people of education should be herded
six together in a horse&#8217;s stall, and in some of the lofts the
bunks touch one another. The light for reading is bad, and
reading is a necessity if these poor prisoners are to be detained
during another winter. In the haylofts above the stables the
conditions are even worse.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>Bishop Bury&#8217;s account (&#8220;My Visit to Ruhleben,&#8221;
p.&nbsp;30) reads:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I don&#8217;t know whether it was our internment at Newbury,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>the race-course for Reading, or our using race-courses, such
as Kempton Park, for the training of our own men, which
caused Ruhleben to be chosen in November, 1914, as a suitable
place for civilians&#8217; internment.... Without any
description of mine it may be easily understood what they
had to suffer until proper arrangements were made....
The loose boxes are now properly fitted with bunks, some
being larger than others. The large corridor, with its stone
floor, gives air and space, the lofts particularly being
extremely well adapted now for their present purpose. I
prefer the lofts to the boxes, because they have corridors out
of which one can look, whereas the windows in the boxes are
usually far above the ground. I went to tea more frequently
in the boxes, and on one occasion we sat down sixteen in
number&mdash;rather a crowd&mdash;but we were quite comfortable.</p></div>

<p>Bishop Bury has seen something on both sides, and
his impressions are for that reason all the more
important. We must not forget, too, that he lived a
week with the prisoners at Ruhleben. It is also only
fair to remember that no one has been invited to spend
a week in any camp on this side. Bishop Bury also
tells us &#8220;that when, a little time ago, the authorities
proposed to relieve the overcrowding and construct
another camp at Havilburg which could accommodate
600 men, the men at once petitioned that this idea
might not be carried out, as they preferred, after this
length of time to stay where they are.&#8221; (l.c., p.&nbsp;40.)</p>

<p>One caution must, however, be given to the readers
of Bishop Bury&#8217;s book. The conditions of the camp
during the excitement and interest of his visit could not
be the normal conditions. The frightful monotony of
the long confinement does not obtrude itself in his
book. Yet there is no doubt, I fear, that internment
everywhere (at Ruhleben, as elsewhere) is becoming
&#8220;intolerable.&#8221; To live, as at Alexandra Palace, day
and night, for <i>years</i> in a great hall with more than a
thousand others must become almost destructive to
any sensitive nature. But (to quote Dr. Siegmund
Schulze once more) &#8220;We ought not to conclude from
this that we are justified in making reproaches....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>in respect of the treatment of prisoners, but rather
conclude that we should work energetically towards
the termination of the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Cimino, very, and very naturally, anti-German
as he is, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The only real suffering we experienced at Ruhleben was
from the cold.... The fact is that he (Count
Schwerin) was as kind-hearted an old soldier as ever fondled
an English wife, and loved his English prisoners....
He used to take part in our daily life as much as possible....
As to the concerts, he was always present, <i>et pour
cause</i>; he was passionately fond of music.... at the end
of the concert he would make his little speech, and we
filed out. But one night we gave him a rousing cheer, and the
whole crowd struck up, &#8220;For he&#8217;s a jolly good fellow.&#8221;
(&#8220;Behind the Prison Bars in Germany,&#8221; p.&nbsp;95).<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p>As to the food question, we must not forget that the
blockade against Germany and the pressure upon
neutrals have been continually increased in stringency.
Up to October, 1915, Mr. Gerard could write as
follows of Ruhleben:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The food material is excellent and the cooking, as I have
stated, is attended to by the prisoners themselves, those doing
the cooking receiving payment from the British fund, with
the exception of 150M. weekly allowed for cooks&#8217; wages by
the German authorities. The prisoners are given, if they
choose, a bread-card, and are allowed to purchase extra bread&mdash;the
Kriegsbrod, which we all use in Germany and which
is quite palatable&mdash;at the price of 55 pfennige a loaf. Food
also, as I have stated, can be purchased in the canteen at
prices very much less than food can be purchased in Berlin,
and at very much less than cost.&mdash;[Miscel, No. 3 (1916)].</p></div>

<p>The low price at the canteen, was, however, I take
it, owing to the existence of the camp fund contributed
to by the British Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Lord Newton spoke in the House of Lords on
February 22, 1917, on the question of prisoners of war.
The following extract is from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
report:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>There was nothing to be gained by exaggerating the
conditions of prisoners in Germany or elsewhere. There was
neither sense nor truth in representing, as was constantly
done, that Ruhleben was a sort of unspeakable hell upon
earth, and that a British internment camp was a kind of
paradise compared with it. He deplored the hardship that
these men underwent, but it was a great mistake to suppose
that these civilians at Ruhleben were undergoing greater hardships
than those being endured by our military prisoners.
Like anyone who ventured to state the facts, he would no
doubt be accused of being a pro-German, but certainly the
conditions at Ruhleben had greatly improved recently. These
conditions had improved, not on account of any action on the
part of the German Government, but rather on account of
their inaction. They had permitted the British there to
organise on their own lines and make the conditions tolerable.
Anyone could satisfy himself as to the conditions, because
there were men who had arrived here recently who could give
the fullest information. In addition, they were able to form
their own opinions to a certain extent from independent testimony,
for example, the visit of Bishop Bury. He could not
understand why this prelate had been subjected to so much
attack on the part of certain persons in this country. He
went to Germany by permission of the German Government.
He went to Ruhleben, lived in the camp, and was able to
see what the conditions were. He reported exactly what he
saw, and was thereupon denounced as not only being an inaccurate
person but obviously pro-German.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Absence on Leave.</span></h3>

<p>The following private testimony is also of interest:
&#8220;A nephew of mine who is interned at Ruhleben has
been let out for a fortnight&#8217;s visit to some people
whose son is interned in England, and who has been
befriended here. My nephew met with the most overwhelming
kindness, and his letters are most interesting
and touching.&#8221; The &#8220;reprisals of good,&#8221; which we
shall consider more fully presently, are, after all, the
most practical measures in the world. There have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>been several other absences on leave, and a good many
men have been released permanently. Moreover, at
Christmas, 1916, most of the British officials in the
camp were given three days leave in Berlin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prisoners&#8217; Activity.</span></h3>

<p>We may well be proud of the organising capacity of
the British prisoners at Ruhleben and of the resolute
determination of so many to make the very most
of every slender opportunity, and to turn difficulties
into a stimulus for ingenuity. The following is from
the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, February 23, 1916:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A letter from Mr. Walter Butterworth, dated January 22,
and written from his internment quarters at Ruhleben, Germany,
has been received by the Chairman of the Manchester
Art Gallery, Mr. F. Todd. After a reference to newly added
pictures in the Manchester Gallery and to the death of his
friend, Mr. Roger Oldham, Mr. Butterworth continues: &#8220;You
will perhaps like to hear a little about art matters in Ruhleben.
We really have some activity in arts and crafts. A
great crowd of musicians are here, including some composers
and many excellently equipped executants. We have actors
in plenty, not without a sprinkling of professionals. Professors,
journalists, and lecturers are our nearest approximation
to workers in the literary field. There is no stint of
craftsmen, who produce very clever work in wood, metals, etc.
With provision tins they make the most astonishing things,
including tackle for our physics and chemical departments,
for weighing, testing, measuring, etc. With only tins and
wire a man made an amazing electrical clock, which has kept
faultless time for over a year. Other men made a handloom
for demonstration purposes, which wove cloth before our eyes
at a meeting of Yorkshiremen, at which I presided.</p>

<p>Turning to the fine arts of painting and sculpture, I did
not know we had any sculptors until this month, except one
clever young artist who models heads in clay. But this month
we have had a great deal of snow, and two men who have
hitherto been resting came forward, and, like Michael Angelo
on a famous occasion began to model in snow. But our
designers and painters are the most numerous and active (after
the musicians). They have a shed, in which art exhibitions
are held periodically. Many portraits are drawn and a few
painted. One artist is just completing a portrait of me in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>pastels. There is an endless outpouring of theatre posters,
caricatures, humorous drawings, skits on the camp, etc.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Six students at Ruhleben passed the London
University Matriculation examination in December,
1916. One of them took the Edinburgh papers as well
later on. (<i>Observer</i>, August 26, 1917.) These are
remarkable cases, for the strain of prolonged internment
seems most of all to affect the power of
concentrated attention.</p>

<p>The case of another successful student is recorded in
the <i>Daily News</i> of June 2, 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The distinction&mdash;probably unique&mdash;of graduating for the
degree of Doctor of Music of Oxford University while a
prisoner in enemy hands has been achieved by Mr. Ernest
Macmillan, a young man with Edinburgh connections. Mr.
Macmillan, who is the son of a clergyman in Toronto, was
studying music in Germany when the war broke out, and
since then he has been interned as a civil prisoner at Ruhleben.
His answer to examination papers and his &#8220;exercise&#8221; (or
composition) were sent from Ruhleben to Oxford.</p></div>

<p>That such things are possible at Ruhleben is a great
tribute to English spirit and endurance. We must
also not forget that they would clearly be wholly
impossible if the Germans were actually barbarians.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Friendly Enemy.</span></h3>

<p>When Bishop Bury during his visit in November,
1915, asked what he might be allowed to say at
Ruhleben, General Friedrich replied: &#8220;Please do all
you can to hearten and cheer up your fellow countrymen.
Appeal to their patriotism, speak to their
manhood. You and they will have no one between
you. There will be no official of the camp; no one to
listen to you, no one to come between yourself and
them. We trust you entirely with them, and you will
understand, I am sure, that we do not wish to
diminish anyone&#8217;s sense of nationality who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>imprisoned or interned in Germany.&#8221; (&#8220;My Visit to
Ruhleben,&#8221; p.&nbsp;21.) The words, says Bishop Bury,
&#8220;seemed to come straight from the heart of the
speaker.&#8221; Some readers will be sceptical; but at least
<i>the words were acted on</i>. The Bishop spoke about
the armies and the war to the men, and told them of
his own experiences in the war area, &#8220;just as I should
have told them to my own countrymen in this
country.&#8221; At his last address the British flag was run
in on a cord and &#8220;God Save the King&#8221; was sung. The
Bishop had no time to propose the omission of the
second verse, but one is proud to know that those
Englishmen, even amidst their excitement, spontaneously
omitted it. The whole scene revealed what was
finest on both sides. Bishop Bury told the German
Staff that at the meeting &#8220;we all sang &#8216;Send him
victorious.&#8217; They smiled indulgently.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">War Terrorism.</span></h3>

<p>A good many more things of a favourable character
could be said. Unfortunately men who speak well of
their German captors are accused of pro-Germanism,
and they dare not speak. This is a rather terrible fact,
but it is a fact. As one man said to me: &#8220;I have
my living to get, and if my identity could be traced
through any account I gave I should be ruined. My
work has already been very materially affected, but in
private conversation I shall continue to speak the
truth, come what may.&#8221; War prejudice indeed desires
one kind of story only, and victimises those who give
it what it does not want. And so all along the line
suppression begets suppression of the truths most
needed to heal our ills. A woman teacher writes to
me: &#8220;I think I have a fairly open mind myself to
recognise good deeds of the enemy; but to tell such to
my pupils is another matter, and I fear would be very
impolitic seeing that I depend on my school for my
daily bread.&#8221; And again the Editor of a provincial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>paper writes: &#8220;...&nbsp;but when one has to rely on the
public for one&#8217;s living one has to think twice before
expressing one&#8217;s views.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Last Days at Ruhleben.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Desmond wrote of the coming of the Revolution
at D&uuml;lmen (vide p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_61">61</a>), Mr. Sylvester Leon has told
us something of the last days at Ruhleben (<i>Herald</i>,
January 4, 1919). &#8220;The soldiers are with you,&#8221; said
Mr. Powell to the interned men. &#8220;For with the
triumph of the Revolution, that friendliness which
had existed in the days of the old r&eacute;gime between the
interned and many an individual German soldier now
became general among the military of Ruhleben; the
officers had flitted, or had capitulated to the new order
of things with more or less grace; Councils of soldiers
and workmen ruled in the towns of the Fatherland;
the era of Social Democracy was dawning upon Central
Europe.... It is but fair to admit that the Ruhleben
Guard acted very loyally in the performance of their
duty. For when they were given the option of
returning to their homes they did not avail themselves
of that opportunity, but volunteered to remain at their
posts until the disbandment of the camp. It is of
historic interest to note that the red flag&mdash;the symbol
of the triumph of the Revolution&mdash;which flew from the
flag-pole in the camp, had formerly done service in the
cubicle of one of the interned. It was dyed red by
another of the interned, a doctor of science and a
member of our little camp school, and then given to
the soldiers.... The first impression gained on a
visit outside the camp was the terrible seriousness of
the food question. No one who has once seen can ever
forget the sight of the crowds of hungry women and
school children standing outside the gates of Ruhleben,
literally besieging the interned as they passed out.&#8221;
For it was only the interned who had food to spare. The
Ruhlebenites gave, they had the facts before them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>And &#8220;the people of Spandau turned out in force to
wish us &#8216;Godspeed&#8217; on our departure for home; and
the send-off they gave us was astonishing in its
enthusiasm, arresting in its spontaneity, and touching
in its obvious sincerity.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Havelberg.</span></h3>

<p>At Havelberg the camp for civilians had a population
of 4,500. Of these only 372 were British subjects,
being men from British India. Mr. Dresel writes on
September 17, 1916: &#8220;This camp produces an
excellent impression, the arrangements being unusually
hygienic and modern.&#8221; [Miscel. No. 7 (1917), p.&nbsp;6.]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">On Behalf of the Civilians.</span></h3>

<p>Yet, however excellent the impression may be, an
internment camp is a miserable place.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is, of
course, especially miserable for those whose nature is
at all sensitive, and it is surely such men whom we
shall need everywhere if we are to make a less brutal
world. Man after man has gone into internment
seeking to employ himself and to make the best of it.
For months, for a year, less often for nearly two years
he has succeeded. But slowly success has dwindled
and turned into failure. The monotony, the sense of
oppression, the physical and mental discomfort, the
deadly uselessness of the life&mdash;even where to these
things is not added concern for those outside&mdash;have
made him incapable of fixed attention, incapable of
effort, incapable of rest, alternately nervous and torpid,
fearful, despairing. The &#8220;barbed wire disease&#8221; has him
in its grip at last. &#8220;Another winter interned here,&#8221;
wrote such a one, &#8220;and I shall need a padded cell.&#8221;
He had a fine nature and had struggled hard. But
&#8220;the people outside do not understand.&#8221; Certainly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>there are those who can hold out to the end. I admire
and envy them. I do not think any of us could predict
with certainty that we should not give way.</p>

<p>There is only one remedy short of stopping the war,
and that is the release of all civilians. Those who wish
to remain, either in Germany or here, should certainly
be allowed to do so, and if the police have no case
against them, and if they can support themselves, they
should be set free. Others should be repatriated or sent
to neutral countries. The imprisonment of civilians is
against the usage of war, and it is this fact which gave
force to the claim of the German Government that
there should be complete release on both sides.</p>

<p>I append extracts from a Swiss appeal to the
belligerents on behalf of the civilian prisoners. It was
issued in August, 1917, and has already appeared in
<i>Common Sense</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A civilian is not a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>We gladly acknowledge that the belligerent powers have
effectively lessened the sufferings of the prisoners of war with
an intelligent understanding of their duty; the military
authorities have listened favourably to the proposals of the
Red Cross, and already the soldiers have been spared many
unnecessary sufferings. Humane measures have softened the
captivity of military prisoners.</p>

<p>In the name of Justice we now address this urgent appeal
to the authorities in the belligerent countries to adopt the
same attitude towards civilian prisoners.</p>

<p>We have in mind all civil prisoners, for these, almost
without exception, are innocent victims of the war; both
those who since the beginning of the war have been interned,
and those others in the occupied territories who have been
isolated, oppressed or imprisoned, many of them in poor
health, women, children, old men, who are not allowed to
join their families in a neutral land. Our deep compassion and
brotherly sympathy are especially moved on behalf of non-combatants
who have been carried away like herds.</p>

<p>We pray all belligerents without distinction to hearken
to our appeal; with dread we watch the approach of another
war-winter, bearing, as it must, a fresh succession of distresses,
deprivations and reprisals. Therefore we cannot keep
silence.... Numbers of civilian prisoners have been
suffering since the beginning of the war from the depressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>conditions of the concentration camps.... The civilian
took no part in the war, and in most cases did not even
desire it. He should not therefore be treated as a prisoner
of war.</p>

<p>Belligerent States! We call upon you to exchange all your
civilians now interned.... This exchange must naturally
be effected under certain conditions to be established. Each
State must bind itself not to employ the liberated civilians
for war-work; just as was arranged in the case of military
prisoners who have been repatriated or sent to neutral
countries. With these conditions, no belligerent should refuse
to liberate the civilians so unjustly imprisoned.</p>

<p>Honour will be theirs who act upon this appeal....</p></div>

<p>The signatories to this appeal are G. Wagni&egrave;re
(Editor of the <i>Journal de Gen&egrave;ve</i>), Dr. A. Forel
(Professor at Zurich University), Ed. Secr&eacute;tan
(National Councillor), Benjamin Vallotton, Charles
Baudouin (Professor at the Institut J.&nbsp;J. Rousseau),
Ch. Bernard, P. Seidel (Professor at the Cantonal
Technical College, Z&uuml;rich), A. de Morsier, Ph. Dunant
(Lawyer of Geneva), Paul Moriand (Professor of
Medicine at Geneva), and MM. Blonde and Arcos.</p>

<p>The Swiss Red Cross has also appealed for the
release of all interned civilians.</p>

<p>From this side the following private appeal on behalf
of all prisoners has been addressed to the Red Cross at
Cologne:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I feel it incumbent upon me ... to draw your attention
to the acute disappointment that is being caused among
the prisoners in all the camps, and almost equally among
their friends outside, by the delay in repatriation. Every
phase in the long series of public discussions and official
negotiations, every hitch, and every hesitation, has been
followed with painful anxiety by those of us who know what
it means for all these thousands of victims languishing in
confinement, and you may be sure, with much more intensely
painful anxiety by the victims themselves, whose ears are
pathetically strained to catch the feeblest echo of any rumour
from the outside world that brings them the slightest hint
of release. For months these poor fellows had been continually
alternating between hope and despair, when the news of
the Hague meeting seemed for large numbers to bring them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>definitely, at long last, within measurable distance of the
reality. Knowing therefore as you do, equally well with us,
the mental condition of these men, and the terribly demoralising
effect of long internment, even under the best conditions,
you will realise the deep depression into which they are now
being plunged by all the inexplicable delays in carrying out
the terms of the convention. From every one who comes in
contact with them I gather the same impression, that unless
the Gordian knot is cut and a way is quickly found out of
the present impasse, the most serious results are to be apprehended,
as numbers of prisoners here&mdash;and the case can
be no better in other countries&mdash;are on the verge of insanity....<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>I would put it therefore to you in all earnestness that
it is your duty, as representing humanity, to bring without
delay all the pressure and all the influence you possess to bear
upon the authorities to consider the sufferings of the prisoners
and induce them, if possible, even at the cost of some concessions,
to facilitate from their side the carrying through of
this scheme, in which I can assure you not merely the happiness
but even the life of many men is involved.</p>

<p>I speak, of course, quite unofficially, and with no other
motive than pure philanthropy, but I may venture to hope that
my representations, though only those of a private individual,
will carry more than ordinary weight, inasmuch as there is
perhaps nobody whose information and experience in these
matters are more real and vital, or entitle him to speak with
more authority.</p>

<p>Nor do I stand alone, for there are many others with whom
I have worked from the beginning in the same field. All
these associate themselves with me in this appeal, and, like
myself, with no other motive than that of simple humanity.
If the time, the energy, and the money we have all spent so
unstintingly to improve the prisoners&#8217; lot give us any title
to be heard, we all implore you, not only for the sake of the
prisoners themselves, but in the eternal interests of humanity
and justice, to do, and to do quickly whatever you can in
furtherance of this object. We quite understand, of course,
that military interests must be considered, but it is not
always possible for those in high places, with whom such
decisions rest, to realise as vividly as we do all that is at
stake in a question of this sort, and that is why we feel
entitled to assume that your advice would not be without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>effect, and that being the case, we submit it becomes your
solemn duty to tender it.</p></div>

<p>The sufferings of this war are indeed vast beyond
all comprehension. Is not there danger that this very
fact may lead us to add to that suffering without
need?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Rotting Away.&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>In a pathetic appeal to be given work the men at one
internment camp here said, &#8220;We are simply rotting
away.&#8221; And others say, &#8220;The people outside do not
understand.&#8221; Loss, heartache, privation, stagnation,
friction, stupid and malicious gossip, mental and
moral deterioration&mdash;&#8220;rotting away.&#8221; This disintegration
of personality, the gradual rotting of the
man&#8217;s selfhood, is perhaps, clearly envisaged, as great
a horror as war can bring. It is not the result of
deliberate cruelty, but simply of conditions most of
which are inevitable if there is to be internment at all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Report on Knockaloe.</span></h3>

<p>The reports available on our own internment camps
do not go back beyond March, 1916.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is perhaps
well to remind ourselves that even by May, 1916,
there were still defects. Thus in the American Report
of May 18, 1916, on Knockaloe, we read: &#8220;The huts
are being put in good weather-proof condition, and are
being protected against the wind and rain by felt and
tarred paper.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> As to sanitation, &#8220;There have been
improvements in the sanitary arrangements since our
last visit.&#8221; &#8220;In the hospital in Camp IV. there is
now being built a recreation room, where convalescents
may sit, which will give more room for the patients;
also a special sink has been provided for washing the
hospital utensils, and new latrines have been installed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>They seem to be at work at this hospital to improve
its condition. As Camp IV. has the largest number of
older men interned, this hospital has more patients
than others, and seemed rather crowded at the time of
our visit.&#8221; &#8220;In the isolation hospital we found only
one bath and one tap for all the patients who are
suffering from various sorts of contagious diseases. We
took this matter up with the proper authorities, who
assured us that it should have their attention. The
sanitary arrangements in all the hospitals might be
improved, except possibly in Camp I.&#8221; &#8220;There were
complaints about the hospital treatment, particularly
of the care of the eyes, ears and teeth, for which the
interned men claimed that there was not sufficient
opportunity for special treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>These last complaints are curiously parallel to some
made at Ruhleben. [See Miscel. No. 3 (1916) pp.&nbsp;3,
15, 16.]</p>

<p>&#8220;There was complaint that there were no shelters
for the men while waiting to receive parcels, nor for
outside patients visiting the doctor. This matter was
taken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Camp III. a complaint was made about the
difficulty of personal intercourse between the representatives
of the camp and the Commandant. This had
caused dissatisfaction. The men seemed to have
confidence in the new Commandant, but they told us
that they had difficulty in approaching him. We took
this matter up with the proper authorities, and were
informed that they would in future have more opportunity
for personal intercourse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The huts for sleeping accommodation &#8220;are sectional,
being of the regular War Office pattern, 30 feet by
15 feet, each section holding thirty men.&#8221; This gives
us a floor space of 450 square feet for each thirty men.
In that portion of the Ruhleben loft most adversely
criticised by Mr. Gerard the roof slopes from 10 feet
at the ridge to a height of 4&frac12; feet only at the sides.
The floor space allowed, however, is 10.2 metres by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>12.8 metres, giving us about 1,390 square feet for 64
men, or 651 square feet for thirty men. When all
allowance is made for the lowness of the sides in the
rather wide loft (it seems to be more than 30 feet wide),
this worst accommodation at Ruhleben seems, as
regards space available, not inferior to that at
Knockaloe. Further details would be needed for a
complete comparison.</p>

<p>The report on Knockaloe is not enthusiastic, but
evidently there had been many improvements, and
still more was hoped for from the new Commandant.
&#8220;The new Commandant, who has only been there
some ten weeks, seems to have gained the confidence
and respect of the interned men. He seems to be doing
all in his power to better the conditions of the camp.
He finds difficulty in getting material, such as tarred
paper or felt, etc., for use on the huts. He told us
that he had the matter in hand, and was giving betterment
of the conditions at the camp every attention.... The
whole tone of the camp is much better than
it was at the time of the last visit. (See report of
January 8, 1916.) There were fewer complaints, and
the prisoners seemed much more contented.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A British Commandant.</span></h3>

<p>It is unfortunate that we cannot &#8220;see&#8221; the earlier
report to which we are directed. But it is good to
know that the new Commandant, Col. F.&nbsp;N. Panzera,
proved to be a Christian gentleman with real sympathy
for the unfortunate men under his charge. Like many
other commandants, both here and in Germany, he did,
amidst the various difficulties, what he could. As he
is, alas, now dead, we may perhaps quote the words
he addressed to the men in his care at the Christmas
of 1916. It is a strange reflection that it might have
injured his position to quote this fine and simple
message during his life-time. Colonel Panzera wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>I am sorry that the size of the camp prevents my seeing
you all, which I should do if it were smaller and thus possible.
It would be a mockery to wish you a &#8220;Happy Christmas,&#8221;
I am afraid, but I wish you as happy a one as is possible
under the circumstances. I most earnestly wish you a
happier New Year. May the New Year bring Peace and
restore you to all dear to you. I hope that prosperity and
happiness may come to you in the future, and may in time
obliterate the memory of the present period of sadness.</p>

<p>I should like to take the opportunity of saying how much
I appreciate the general good behaviour of the camps during
the past year. There have been little lapses, as there must
always be in a mixed community of 25,000 people, but on
the whole the conduct has been extremely good, which has
been a great help to those placed over you. Once more I wish
you as good a Christmas as possible and a better New Year.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Food Difficulties.</span></h3>

<p>The food question also becomes increasingly serious
in the camps, as it does in prisons. I confess I feel
we ought to ration ourselves very strictly before we
cut down the supplies of our prisoners, criminal or
otherwise. &#8220;The reduced diet,&#8221; wrote Fenner
Brockway of his prison experiences, &#8220;is one of semi-starvation,
and every prisoner is becoming thin and
physically weak.&#8221; (<i>Labour Leader</i>, September 6.
1917.) Those who care to inquire of the wives of
interned men will learn their side of the case as regards
the effect of changed conditions in the camps. The
sad feature is that the increasing rigour comes upon
men already weakened, both physically and mentally,
by long confinement. The original published statement
of Sir Edward (now Viscount) Grey [Misc. 7
(1915), p.&nbsp;23] no longer obtains. The food is, of
course, very different, and may not be supplemented.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Two Kinds of Rumour and Some Reality.</span></h3>

<p>I have not cared to quote adverse &#8220;unofficial
information and rumours,&#8221; either as regards our own
or other detention camps. What some adverse critics
say about our own may be read in the <i>Woman&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>Dreadnought</i>, Vol III., p.&nbsp;551. The rather terrible
appeal of the Captains at Knockaloe is also printed
on p.&nbsp;561. It is a letter which is unwise and hysterical.
I do not wonder at its hysteria, and I confess that
some things in the letter hit me rather hard. But,
alas, the desperation of the interned men on either
side does not help towards wise judgment, and for that
desperation we are all, in every country, in some
measure responsible. It is best to remember instead
the real sympathy that those actually in touch with
prisoners do often feel. Colonel Panzera&#8217;s message
is clear evidence of this, and from a private letter I
take the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The attitude of prejudice or even hatred towards enemies,
whether prisoners or not, often disappears when men are
brought face to face in the work of an internment camp, for
example, and find that they are very much like each other.
An officer of a certain camp here was taken prisoner and
interned for six months in Germany before he escaped. He
says that two or three times the officers of the camp were
changed, and in each case began with harsh treatment, either
the result of official suggestion or of the general feeling. In
each case, after the lapse of a short time, close acquaintance
modified this attitude, and finally kindly relations and treatment
resulted. In the same way the nurses in a certain
hospital here refused to receive or treat German prisoners
until a company of the wounded men arrived, when the feeling
of natural humanity proved too strong, and they were quite
eager to attend to them. At the internment camps in this
country the officers generally speak of the men under their
charge with humanity and respect.</p></div>

<p>The following is significant. &#8220;In the town near a
certain internment camp of ours much indignation was
roused by the story that some of the interned aliens
had set in motion some railway trucks on a sloping
siding, with the intention of allowing them to crash
into an arriving passenger train at the bottom. An
English friend of mine happened to observe the real
origin of the story. The trucks <i>began to move in an
accidental way, and two or three of the aliens nearly
lost their own lives, certainly risked serious accident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>in endeavouring to stop the trucks when they were
already moving</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus in the quiet neighbourhood of an internment
camp a brave deed becomes by popular passion transformed
into something monstrous. What would this
popular imagination do in an invaded district? Its
vagaries must be experienced and studied by any
investigator of the atrocities of war.</p>

<p>Another example of heroism amongst German
prisoners I take from the <i>Daily News</i> of April 30, 1918.
A small boat in which two men were sailing capsized
about 200 yards out from the Leasowe Embankment,
Cheshire. The men, clinging to the bottom of the boat,
were being driven out by the tide when two members
of an escort of German prisoners, Sergeant Phillips
and Private Matthews, jumped into the water and
with difficulty brought one man back. One of the
German prisoners, named Bunte, volunteered to go
to the rescue of the other man, who was by then in
great danger. The German swam out strongly and
brought the man back.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Against Bitterness.</span></h3>

<p>I fear that on both sides it is embittered men who
will be released from the civilian internment camps.
People do not realise how financial ruin, harassment,
illness and death (to which the harassment may have
contributed) follow in the track of internment. A man
is interned, his wife and family are reduced to a mere
pittance, the woman is, it may be, delicate. She
falls ill and dies.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> And amid such incidents and the
mental strain of the confinement a brooding hatred
gradually settles down upon the souls of these sufferers.
Personally, I do not feel one can expect much favourable
memory of the authorities on either side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Certainly every one who has worked for prisoners is
touched by their gratitude, but the iron has entered
into their souls for all that. And perhaps it is well
to remind ourselves that a far larger number of civilians
have been suffering in the internment camps on this
side. Let us not add to their bitterness by unworthy
abuse or credulous malice. Men who, after long
confinement for no offence of their own, have tried to
save enemy lives, and find their efforts described as
an attempt at murder, must begin to feel hopeless of
justice. Excess of generosity would be far wiser. The
world wants no more missioners of hate. Let us try
to avoiding creating such.</p>

<p>In our own internment camps there was often, even
early in the war, an atmosphere of depression which
one worker said &#8220;haunted him for days.&#8221; The following
extract is from the letter of an interned man who
showed quite remarkable courage and fought with
considerable success against depression till the end of
1917. &#8220;I refuse to give way to depression,&#8221; he
wrote. But in 1918 the strain of useless monotony
had become too great, he became physically ill, and
how low hope had fallen the letter itself shows: &#8220;You
can&#8217;t think how good it is to hear you speak with so
much sympathy. I feel sure you understand the
dreariness of this life, the long and fruitless waiting,
the nights of anguish&mdash;and all the misery of it, the
terrible discontent and the passionate heart longings....
You don&#8217;t know how sore it is sometimes about
my heart....&#8221;</p>

<p>Methods that seem to many of us avoidable contribute
also to increase ill-feeling. I take the following
from the <i>Daily News</i> of September, 27, 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Among others, I had my Christmas dinner last year with
a German. At least, his name is German and he was born in
Germany. He is less interested, personally, in those facts
than in these, viz., that he is an international Socialist and
a first class electrical engineer. For four years he has done
extremely responsible work for a large engineering firm with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>important contracts from the M. of M. For four years he has
had his liberty within the usual five-mile radius; for four years
the local police have not found the least fault with him.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to the Northcliffe Intern-them-all-Stunt, he is
shut up in the Isle of Man, and the country has lost the
services of a man who was worth more to us than many
Northcliffes.</p>

<p>From a letter which he wrote recently to an English friend
I have copied the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p>As a result of the fact that no German paper is permitted
here in the camp, not even those advocating understanding
nor those critical of the German Government, and practically
no English paper hitherto except those abounding in
Hun-talk, there is still a general feeling here towards
&#8220;England&#8221; exactly the opposite of what these restrictions
are intended to create&mdash;a bitterness and a contempt which
exist side by side with the most violent criticism of the
governing clique of Germany, and with anti-capitalistic,
revolutionary sentiment! So I am exerting myself to make
people realise that, however influential, the Northcliffe and
Allied Press is not &#8220;England,&#8221; and that the best German
papers constantly work for the abatement of hatred and
for genuine reconciliation and co-operation in a League of
Nations.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I am sorry to say that I fear acts of kindness and
fairness will be largely forgotten by the majority of
prisoners on both sides. An Englishman writes to me
of his treatment in Germany: &#8220;Consideration was
extended in even greater measure to others, yet not
one has opened his mouth to record it. It makes one
loathe one&#8217;s fellow-men.&#8221; I quote this because I am
sure that neither side must expect fairness of statement
from men so long exposed to so depressing and
often petty a constraint. After all, when we see the
war bias of the man who has not suffered at all, a calm
regard for both sides of the case can scarcely be
expected from those who for wasted years have been
too often exposed to hardship, petty tyranny and a
kind of barbed annoyance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neutral Camps.</span></h3>

<p>Even in neutral internment camps, though there the
initial hostility is absent, misery and bitterness may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>become very great. The following cable from Rotterdam
appeared in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of June 13,
1918:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Interned Britishers here are intensely interested in the
British-German Conference at the Hague, in the hope that it
may result in their repatriation. This is especially the case
at Groningen, where the men of the Royal Naval Division,
who have been interned since October, 1914, are getting
desperate. The June number of the camp magazine had two
blank pages, which the editor explains have been censored
out because they contained an account of the recent &#8220;hunger
demonstration&#8221; and &#8220;a moderate record of the general feeling
of the camp.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It is in the internment camps everywhere, rather
than in the fighting line, that bitterness sinks into
the soul. It will not be remedied by more bitterness.
But if the suffering of these men&#8217;s stagnant years
helps to strengthen a universal resolve for peace it will
not have been a useless suffering. And peace means
understanding by each of the good in the other.</p>

PRISONERS IN PREVIOUS WARS.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Previous Records.</span></h3>


<p>The suffering of prisoners has been great enough,
God knows, yet if we are to help the future we must
try to see even this, amongst the other terrible facts,
in its proper perspective. The imprisonment of
resident enemy nationals has certainly been a most
unfortunate step backwards&mdash;unfortunate even if we
regard it as inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Yet we must recognise that
far more solicitude has been shown as to prisoners than
was the case in most earlier wars, and this though
prisoners have never been taken on so large a scale,
and though there has probably never been greater
embitterment. It will be useful to cite a few previous
records.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Napoleonic Wars.</span></h3>

<p>I quote once more from Dr. Spaight&#8217;s work, where
much information may be found in a condensed form.
&#8220;A hundred years ago, England, while she prayed in
her national liturgy for all prisoners and captives, had
no compunction about confining the French prisoners
of war in noisome hulks and feeding them on weevily
biscuits, salt junk and jury rum, which sowed the seed
for a plentiful harvest of scurvy, dysentery and
typhus.&#8221; (&#8220;War Rights on Land,&#8221; p.&nbsp;265.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">American Civil War.</span></h3>

<p>Here is a description of the state of things in the
Confederate internment camp at Andersonville during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>the American Civil War, which, after all, did not
happen so very long ago. &#8220;Over 30,000 prisoners
were cooped up in a narrow space; there was no
shelter from the sun or cold but what the men could
improvise for themselves; every possible disease was
rampant; the prisoners were largely naked; the dead
were pitched into a ditch and covered with quicklime;
the smell of the dreadful stockade extended for two
miles.... The state of affairs was known, or might
have been known, at Richmond, for Colonel Chandler,
inspector-general of the Confederate army, inspected
the camp, and reported upon its administration in no
halting terms. &#8216;It is a place,&#8217; he said, &#8216;the horrors
of which it is difficult to describe&mdash;it is a disgrace to
civilisation.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the prisoners returning from the South, Whitman
writes: &#8220;The sight is worse than any sight of battlefield
or any collection of wounded, even the bloodiest.
There was (as a sample) one large boat load of several
hundreds&mdash;and out of the whole number only three individuals
were able to walk from the boat. Can those be
<i>men</i>&mdash;those little, livid, brown, ash-streaked, monkey-looking
dwarfs?&#8221; (<i>Cambridge Magazine</i>, August 26,
1916, Supplement &#8220;Prisoners,&#8221; p. iv.) In spite of
such appalling horrors (worse than the atrocities of rage
and fear and drink) the North and South became
reconciled, and with the passing of war bitterness
passed too. The South was hard pressed, supplies
often ran out, and there was indifference at Richmond.
And so the military bullies often got the upper hand,
and their appetite for bullying grew with what it fed
on. The North refused all exchanges. &#8220;The prisoners
at Richmond, Belle-Isle, and Andersonville were the
pawns in a great match, and had to be sacrificed to
the rigour of the game.&#8221; (Spaight, <i>l.c.</i>, p.&nbsp;270.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Franco-German War</span>, 1870.</h3>

<p>In the Franco-German War of 1870 terrible hardships
were endured by prisoners on both sides. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>winter transport to Germany in open trucks led to
scenes of indescribable misery for the French
prisoners, who arrived sometimes &#8220;frozen to the
boards in their own filth.&#8221; German prisoners at Pau
had for six days only bread and water till English and
German ladies took pity on them. Faidherbe&#8217;s
prisoners had no fire, no blankets and insufficient food
in a cold of sixteen degrees. Things now are at least
better than that.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Russo-Japanese War, 1904.</span></h3>

<p>The Japanese seem to have behaved remarkably well
to their Russian prisoners in the Russo-Japanese War.
But even here there was a food problem. The
Japanese food did not suit the Russian soldier, and
Sir Ian Hamilton was told by Russian prisoners going
South that they felt hungry again half an hour after
eating their ration of rice. The Japanese have
usually been held up as models for their treatment of
prisoners, yet, for all that, Professor Ariga admits that
in Manchuria the prisoners were <i>in many cases badly
fed, badly housed and insufficiently clothed</i>. We know
that this involves great misery, suffering and mortality,
yet we are, quite rightly, very far from considering the
Japanese as barbarians. We are ready to consider their
difficulties. Were we, however, fighting Japan, we
should not be so ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boer War.</span></h3>

<p>There is plenty of evidence of good treatment of
prisoners on both sides during the Boer War. It is
in these days strange to find the German General Staff
historian quoted in defence of the British treatment
of prisoners. They behaved, he wrote, &#8220;as perfect
gentlemen towards the prisoners.&#8221; &#8220;The testimony
of a responsible writer of this kind,&#8221; says Dr. Spaight,
&#8220;is more valuable than the catch-penny stories of
British inhumanity which flooded the Press of Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>at the time of the war.&#8221; &#8220;One is surprised to find
such a writer as M. Arthur Desjardins lending his
authority to back the uninformed newspaper abuse,
and ascribing the brutality of the British Army (which
he presumes) to the fact that &#8216;a certain number of
its soldiers, accustomed to fighting away from Europe,
have not the least notion of the laws and customs of
war obtaining among civilised nations&#8217;.&#8221; (Spaight,
<i>l.c.</i>, p.&nbsp;275.) Dr. Spaight&#8217;s comments on such outbursts
is: &#8220;There was a popular demand [in Europe]
at the time for denunciation of England, the hotter the
better, and the writers were too good journalists not
to suit their output to the popular taste.&#8221; I will not
spoil the rather rich humour of these extracts by any
remarks of my own.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Boers usually behaved well.
Undoubtedly, too, there were some bad lapses. A
Free State commandant was, for instance, convicted
of putting prisoners in the firing line and driving
starving prisoners on foot with a mounted commando.
Such things, however, were very far from being the
rule. During the guerilla warfare treatment depended
entirely on the local commandants. The stripping of
prisoners before they were turned adrift was often
carried out, &#8220;and there is some force in De Wet&#8217;s
contention that the seizure was justified by the British
practice of removing or burning all the clothes left in
the farms and even taking the hides out of the tanning
tubs and cutting them in pieces.&#8221; In some cases
starving, unarmed and practically naked men were
abandoned far from any white settlement. What is
and what is not allowable in war seems so largely a
matter of &#8220;military necessity&#8221; that the layman is
reluctant to comment, for, in the last resort, it is only
the <i>needlessly</i> barbarous that is condemned in war.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Concentration Camps.</span></h3>

<p>On our side, we cannot, I think, contemplate the
history of the concentration camps with equanimity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Let us recall a few of the facts. The following are
amongst the death rates recorded in July, 1901:
Norval&#8217;s Pont, 218.4 (per thousand per annum);
Bloemfontein, 242.4; Springfontein, 462.0; Kronstad,
459.6. In June the <i>average</i> death rate was practically
200 (199.3). In the year ending February, 1902, the
official returns (which are incomplete) show more than
20,000 deaths in camps with an average total population
of about 100,000.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Our accusers said the camps
were instituted for the purpose of killing off the Boer
population. The truth is, the feeling against Britain,
even amongst the onlookers, was extremely bitter,
and great bitterness does not make for sane judgment.
What is certain is that the camps illustrated some of
the callousness and carelessness which war always
produces. &#8220;The sites chosen for the camps were
mostly chosen on purely military grounds, and were
often unsuitable; the medical and sanitary staff was
at first insufficient,&#8221; writes Dr. Spaight. But,
&#8220;unsuitable sites, and insufficient&#8221; sanitation may
produce terrible results, where human lives are concerned,
and one would not convert an adverse critic
by simply quoting the &#8220;<i>Times</i> History&#8221; to the effect
that &#8220;the Boers themselves proved to be helpless,
utterly averse to cleanliness, and ignorant of the
simplest principles of health and sanitation.&#8221; The
attempt to shift the chief burden of responsibility on
to the prisoners is surely scarcely chivalrous. Carelessness
and ignorance amongst the prisoners are
certain in all such cases to be contributory causes,
they are amongst the difficulties to be combatted, but
to suggest that they should have been permitted to
produce such appalling results is to court derision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>Moreover, the chief authority on the subject, Lieut.-Col.
S.&nbsp;J. Thomson, C.I.E., I.M.S., who became
Director of Burgher Camps in February, 1902, by no
means supports these charges. &#8220;Much has been
said,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;about the want of personal cleanliness
among the Boers, but it must be remembered
that ablutions are apt to be less frequent and popular
when water has to be laboriously brought from considerable
distances, as is often the case with farms
on the veldt. When bathrooms were provided in the
camps, they were very freely and regularly used.
Nevertheless it is a fact that the Boer&#8217;s notion of
sanitation as understood by Englishmen is very
vague, and all classes resort for purposes of nature to
the open country. This custom, probably innocuous
enough under the conditions of existence on an
isolated homestead, made it extremely difficult to
maintain the cleanliness of a camp site, and it was
very long before the people could be brought to see
that foul matters and dirty water could not be most
satisfactorily disposed of by the simple process of
flinging them out of the tent. It was found indeed
that such proceedings had hopelessly fouled certain
camps, and the removal of the people to a fresh site
was followed by the best results. In a later chapter,
the procedure which was found most successful is
described in detail.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In July, 1902, the average
death rate for the Burgher Camps had sunk to 23.0,
and it fell afterwards even lower.</p>

<p>Tents were, in general, the only housing allowed,
and this, though &#8220;the cold in the &#8216;upper veldt&#8217;
country in winter was intense.&#8221; (Thomson.) What
were known as <i>bona fide</i> refugees were allowed meat,
but those who had their man on commando were, at
first, allowed none. This was altered, however, in
March, 1901. As to the families of this class, Major
Goodwin reported in this month: &#8220;I would, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>beg respectfully to here place on record my opinion
that had we compelled class 3 to decide between
unprotected starvation on their farms, and at their
homes, or taking up their quarters in or behind the
enemy&#8217;s lines, we should have facilitated the work of
proselytism.&#8221; Thus readily, we observe, may the
starvation of women and children be advocated by an
English Major as an aid to &#8220;proselytism.&#8221; There
were other ways in which &#8220;military necessity&#8221;
showed itself. A Board of three reported on the site
of Merebank Camp in December, 1901. The President
was Surgeon-Gen. Clery, C.B., and the two
members, Col. McCormack, R.A.M.C., and Mr.
Ernest Hill, Health Officer of Natal. &#8220;The Board is
of opinion that the site is by no means an ideal site,
and has imperfection as regards elevation, drainage,
etc., but do not recommend that the camp should be
removed ... for the following reasons: (1) It is
necessary that any camp should be on a railway line.
(2) Purely sanitary arrangements as to site have to be
held subservient to military exigencies. The latter do
not permit the camps being located in the uplands, as
military and civil traffic arrangements make it
essential that the main line should not be further congested,&#8221;
... and so on. The Camp had been condemned
by the Ladies&#8217; Commission.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The view I have given is the view admitted gradually
and reluctantly by officials themselves. Miss Hobhouse
gives a rather different account of things. In
the earlier days of the camps, she tells me, the condition
of things might be summarised thus: &#8220;Overcrowding
(up to sixteen in a bell-tent)&mdash;no water
supply&mdash;no soap&mdash;no beds or bedding&mdash;no fuel supplied&mdash;no
utensils&mdash;barest rations&mdash;sanitary staff
inefficient or non-existent.&#8221; In &#8220;The Brunt of the
War&#8221; Miss Hobhouse writes on page 118 of Bloemfontein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Camp: &#8220;My request for soap was met with
the reply, &#8216;Soap is a luxury.&#8217; ... Finally it was
requisitioned for, also forage<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;more tents&mdash;boilers to
boil the drinking water&mdash;water to be laid on from the
town&mdash;and a matron for the camp. Candles, matches,
and such like I did not aspire to. It was about three
weeks before the answer to the requisition came, and
in the interim I gave away soap. Then we advanced
a step. Soap was to be given, though so sparingly as
to be almost useless&mdash;forage was too precious&mdash;brick
boilers might be built&mdash;but to lay on a supply of water
was negatived, as &#8216;the price was prohibitive.&#8217; Later
on, after I had visited other camps, and came back to
find people being brought in by the hundred and the
population rapidly doubling, I called repeated attention
to the insufficient sanitary accommodation, and
still more to the negligence of the camp authorities in
attending to the latrines. I had seen in other camps
that under proper administrative organisation all could
be kept sweet and clean. But week after week went
by, and daily unemptied pails stood till a late hour in
the boiling sun, and the tent homes of the near section
of the camp were rendered unbearable by the
resulting effluvia.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sentence at page 120 has a bearing upon other wars
and other helpers of distressed &#8220;enemies&#8221;:&mdash;&#8220;It became
clear to my astonished mind that both the censorship
and system of espionage were not merely military
in character, but political and almost personal, so that
even to feel, much more to show, sympathy to the
people was to render yourself suspect.... Everyone
knows what class of men accept the work which means
spying upon neighbours, and can draw their own conclusions
as to the value of such reports.&#8221;</p>

<p>As regards the food ration it has been seriously contended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>by others besides Miss Hobhouse (<i>e.g.</i>, T.&nbsp;S.
Haldane, M.D., F.R.S.), that it was totally inadequate.
Dr. Haldane considered that &#8220;nothing but
seething discontent&#8221; and &#8220;an enormous death-rate&#8221;
could be expected from the dietary allowed.
(<i>l.c.</i> p.&nbsp;159.) But those who wish to learn more about
this and many other matters should consult Miss Hobhouse&#8217;s
remarkable book.</p>

<p>The truth is, the prisoner&#8217;s lot is always hard, and
all nations have at times made it a terrible one. It is
only the recognition of brotherhood that can alter this,
and the recognition of brotherhood would end war.</p>

REPRISALS OF GOOD.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword">For</span> the information contained in this chapter I am
greatly indebted to the Friends&#8217; Emergency Committee.
Most of it has already appeared in their
leaflets and reports, and in articles in <i>The Friend</i>.
The following is a reprint of a letter sent by the
Bishop of Winchester to the <i>Times</i>. It appeared in the
issue of September 29, 1916:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Work for Prisoners.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Sir,&mdash;The following facts, if you can find space for them,
will, I think, be of interest and encouragement amidst all the
sorrow and misery of war.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;reprisals&#8221; is often heard in diplomacy and in
war; reprisals are attempted or suggested; or reprisals of
cruelty are condemned, we rejoice to know, by the instinct
and conscience of the nation. These are all reprisals of what
is bad. Rarer, at least on the surface, are reprisals of good.
But here is such a case.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war members of the Society of
Friends and others came together for the purpose of bringing
help to those men and women of enemy nationality in this
country upon whom the war had brought suffering. Their
lot was often a pitiable one. The pull of contrary affections,
the unkindness of former friends, the sudden loss of means of
livelihood, the internment of the men, with its enforced idleness,
were some of the troubles which would have produced
despair in many cases had not the members of this
&#8220;Emergency Committee&#8221; (169, St. Stephen&#8217;s House, Westminster)<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
come to the rescue. They have given material help
to thousands of families, and, above all, brought the healing
touch of human sympathy to the men in the camps and their
wives and children (mostly British-born) left to struggle on
alone outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>It was early in the war also that a group of Germans came
together in Berlin and determined to start a similar work.
The news of what was being done by the British Committee
soon reached them and made them increase their efforts.
Since then the two bodies have been in close communication,
and each has endeavoured to see that what is done for &#8220;alien
enemies&#8221; in one country is promptly repeated in the other.</p>

<p>Among the recent activities of the Berlin Committee has
been the organising of travelling facilities and hospitality for
wives from other parts of Germany, who are now allowed to
visit their husbands at Ruhleben Camp; and it is now making
vigorous efforts to co-ordinate and increase the work of the
various agencies in Germany that are trying to lighten the
lot of the military and civilian prisoners of war in their
camps. At the end of June, I learn, a meeting in support
of this work was held at the house of Prince Lichnowsky,
former Ambassador in London, who returned specially from
the front to preside. Many notable men and women were
present, and a collection of 8,000 marks was made.</p>

<p>My reasons for writing to you with this information are
two. In the first place, because these Berlin workers are
incessantly spreading, through the German Press and otherwise,
news of the doings of the British Committee, and even
in this matter there should be reprisals. And, secondly, one
cannot be too thankful to be able to put on record instances
of that common humanity which we knew must exist in some
quarters even among our enemies, overleaping national hates
and prejudices, and which in this great work of Dr. Siegmund
Schultze and his colleagues is so active and persistent. The
names of several who are diligent in the work in Germany
are those of men personally known to me in respect and
affection; and (whatever their views of war and of Britain
may be&mdash;which I do not know) I can feel as sure of their
simple sincerity and good purpose as if they were my own
countrymen. This may be, perhaps, an added excuse for
troubling you.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>The German work is an offshoot of the general work
undertaken by the Enquiry and Assistance Agency for
Germans abroad and foreigners in Germany (<i>Auskunfts-
und Hilfsstelle f&uuml;r Deutsche im Ausland und
Ausl&auml;nder in Deutschland</i>). The following is a translation
of the appeal issued by the parent society:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>The war has caused great distress amongst countless
Germans in foreign countries. In helping our countrymen we
have to rely almost exclusively on the benevolence of the
societies which have been for years in co-operation with us in
those countries, especially upon our English and American
co-workers in the religious societies for international friendship.
In England, where great difficulties for German subjects
might have been expected from the exceptional conditions
prevailing, a Committee was formed directly the war broke
out, whose object was to provide support for distressed
Germans and Austrians in England; and already many
Germans have told us verbally and in writing of the valuable
help given to them by this Committee.</p>

<p>In consequence of many requests and complaints we have
felt that it was our duty to interest ourselves in those
foreigners who were in difficulties in Germany. At a time
when the German people, from the highest to the lowest, have
joined together in the consciousness of a stern defence against
their enemies, and are fighting out the great struggle for
existence and freedom, it may well appear to many that it is
superfluous to render to the alien enemies amongst us any
more than the most necessary services. But we have not
only to think of those Germans who are now abroad, not only
to remember that those foreigners who are in need in Germany
are for the most part Germany&#8217;s best friends and are bound
to us by a thousand ties; besides all this the task is laid
upon us by our own desire to render friendly service in these
times of hatred to those who now find it so difficult to obtain
help. Even in war time, whoever needs our help is our
neighbour, and love of their enemies remains the distinguishing
mark of those who are loyal to our Lord.</p>

<p>We have accordingly decided to establish a Berlin Enquiry
and Assistance Office to work with the corresponding offices
at home and abroad, especially with the above-mentioned
Emergency Committee in London, the Berne and Stuttgart
Peace Bureaux, etc. We beg for help and gifts, which may be
sent to the following address: Berliner Auskunfts- und
Hilfsstelle f&uuml;r Deutsche im Ausland und Ausl&auml;nder in
Deutschland; communications to be addressed to Fr&auml;ulein
Dr. Elisabeth Rotten, Berlin No. 18, Friedenstrasse 60.</p>

<p>The signatories to this appeal were: Prof. W. Foerster,
Ehrich Gramm (Banker), Dr. Kleineidam (Provost), Eduard
de Neufville, Prof. Rade, Julius Rohrbach (Pastor), Dr.
Elisabeth Rotten, Dr. Alice Solomon, F. Siegmund-Schultze
(Pastor), Dr. Spiecker, Pastor Umfried.</p></div>

<p>It is important to note that of the families and
others helped by the Committee, the largest percentage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>(49) were English. Russians made up 24 per cent, and
French 9 per cent. (Dr. Elisabeth Rotten&#8217;s circular
of April, 1916.)</p>

<p>The following documents explain themselves:&mdash;Extract
from a letter of Dr. Elisabeth Rotten, dated
January 6, 1916.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>In spite of the fact that the numbers of permanent workers
in the office and out of it increase all the time, we have work
here from morning to night, often including holidays. But we
do it gladly, for it is a labour of love. At present our chief
work lies in taking home French children from the occupied
territory of France. In Belgium this work is now nearly
discharged, and a lady has only to go there once more, this
month, to fetch the last batch of children. The French
children are not fetched by our delegates; they travel in the
larger trains for civilians, who are brought from the occupied
territory of France, through Switzerland, back into the
unoccupied<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> parts. What we now have to do is to see that
the children who had been left behind, separated from their
parents, are reunited with them as quickly as possible. The
children themselves seldom know where their parents are, but
we have the addresses through working in conjunction with
the International &#8220;Feminist&#8221; Bureau at Lausanne. This
creates a great deal of correspondence with the respective
authorities. I am glad to be able to add that the [German]
War Office has come forward with sympathy to help us in
this work.</p>

<p>We have sent large consignments of warm clothing and
food&mdash;including honeycake&mdash;to the civilian prisoners&#8217; camps
at Ruhleben and Holzminden, to be distributed among those
that received nothing from other sources. French and Russian
civilians are interned at Holzminden.</p>

<p>German women workers in connection with our Committee
in other parts have also sent Christmas gifts to the camps
nearest them. I enclose extracts from letters from Fr&auml;ulein
Jens, of Hamburg, and Frau Kirchhoff, of Bremen, which I
put at your disposal. The Berlin Committee of the Women&#8217;s
Suffrage Union has done the same for D&ouml;beritz, and other
Committees in South and West Germany have also carried out
similar work. It is of particular interest to note that the
request that German women might remember the prisoners of
war in such a way came from a German soldier at the front.
The ladies were already planning something of the sort, and
would certainly have done it; but still, such a request, so
heartily and earnestly expressed, is remarkable.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>From Frau Senator Kirchhoff, December 28, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The camp at Achim, near Bremen, in the province of
Hanover, is called Etelsen Moor. Frau Schmitt and I finished
off everything in one day, and early on the 23rd we drove out
with two large trunks and three cardboard boxes. Altogether
we had collected 536 marks; 190 went to Frau Feist, 100
marks cash went to the camp at Etelsen. Our trunks contained
40 flannel shirts and 40 pairs of pants, 40 pairs of
slippers, 32 pairs of socks, mittens, helmets, scarves, 1,000
cigars, 100 cakes of chocolate, 25 note-books, 50 pencils, 50
blotters, drawing paper, india rubber, calendars, etc. Three
prisoners&mdash;two Belgian and one Frenchman&mdash;came with two
wheelbarrows; they were accompanied by two German non-commissioned
officers. The men were exceedingly pleased:
the German soldier said they had long been wishing to give
the men presents and were happy that we had made it
possible for them to do so. Afterwards I received two charming
letters; one from the Commandant, who thanked me very
heartily. They had been able to give every prisoner&mdash;chiefly
Belgians and French, but also Russians and one Englishman&mdash;a
present. He enclosed a touching, grateful letter from a
Belgian prisoner, an adjutant, and a programme of their
Christmas theatricals. I have seldom been so glad about anything
as I am that this has been a success.</p></div>

<p>From Fr&auml;ulein Jens, December 30, 1915. Work at
Hamburg.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>We had altogether about 400 marks, and out of this fund
100 parcels containing each about 3 marks worth of goods
were purchased and handed over with 100 marks in money&mdash;for
sick and needy prisoners&mdash;into the care of the camp chaplain.
He took the opportunity of explaining in our presence
to three of the camp &#8220;Captains,&#8221; an Englishman, a Frenchman
and a Russian, the object of the gift. They were greatly
touched and most grateful. The Englishman thanked us in
the name of his country. We were only sorry that we could
not do far, far more, but if even this little is a seed of corn
which may in the future bring forth thoughts of reconciliation
between the nations we shall be happy. Our presents were
given for the New Year, as it is the custom for English and
French to make presents then....</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some Thanks on Both Sides.</span></p>

<p>The following is from the Prisoners&#8217; Aid Society of
the German civilians interned in Camp III., Knockaloe,

<div class="blockquote"><p>To the Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans,
Austrians and Hungarians in Distress.</p>

<p>Dear Madam,&mdash;We do not wish to fail to remember at the
beginning of the New Year with gratitude those who, during
the past difficult year, have made it their task to alleviate,
wherever possible, the misery and the most pressing sorrows
of such families who, by their internment as prisoners of war,
were deprived of their bread-winners. When assembled in
silent prayer during the last festive season&mdash;the season of
Peace and Goodwill to all mankind&mdash;our hearts felt the particular
necessity of expressing our innermost thanks to your
Committee for all the magnanimous acts of brotherly love and
relief shown and granted to the dependents of the interned.</p>

<p>Whilst we venture to ask you to see in these few lines the
unanimous vote of thanks of all the prisoners of war at
Knockaloe Camp III., and kindly bring it to the notice of
those who in a self-sacrificing manner generously assisted your
work of love, we, the undersigned, respectfully offer our heartfelt
wishes for the New Year.</p>

C.&nbsp;P. Toellner, Treasurer; B. Pflug, Hospital.</p></div>

<p>And here we have an extract from a letter of
gratitude from some Serbian prisoners to one of the
German Committees. It was despatched by the
Serbian Aid Committee at the camp Frankfurt-am-Oder,
on February 22, 1917. &#8220;The hundred or so
parcels for Serbian Prisoners of War mentioned in
your kind letter of December 20, 1916, came to hand in
good time and in good condition from Switzerland, and
were distributed to those who were in the weakest condition,
and those who were most needy. In all there
were 94 parcels, and you have the blessing of 94 human
beings, ill, weak, and altogether deserted by the
world. As our former camp (Halbe b. Berlin) was
broken up just at that time and distributed amongst
four other camps, we have only just learned who it was
who had given us such kindly and noble thoughts. We
thank you therefore once more with our whole heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>for your great goodness and charity&mdash;God will repay it
to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gifts (the many good and beautiful things)
reached us here in good time, and were divided
amongst Serbians who [were in various camps] and
the remainder we distributed here on Christmas Eve
in the camp. You should have seen the joy of these
poor men!... May God only grant a speedy
peace!... While thanking you heartily once again,
we beg you to think of us in the future also....
P.S.&mdash;In all the camps belonging to our group we have
a total of 30-40 sick men.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">&#8220;Joining Hands with the Enemy.&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>The spirit produced by reprisals of good is well shown
in the following extracts from an article in <i>The Friend</i>.
(April 20, 1917):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>There have been fresh evidences lately of the response from
Germany to our efforts here, and of the likeness between our
work and that of the Berlin Committee. The animating
spirit is evidently so much the same that a wife left behind

&#8220;Just write your letter and send it to <i>St. Stephen&#8217;s House</i>
at Berlin, and they&#8217;ll send it for you.&#8221; The italics are ours.</p>

<p>Dr. Rotten wrote March 8:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a few lines to tell you that a second parcel from Berne

copies of &#8220;A Day at St. Stephen&#8217;s House.&#8221; We are much
pleased to make these vivid descriptions of your assistance
to the Germans in England accessible to so many, as our
experience has taught us that direct information has a much
greater effect than our own full or abbreviated translations.
But we try again and again with the latter, and at the present
moment two different sketches of our endeavours in England
and Germany for mutual help have been accepted by various
papers, so we may hope to be able to send you a copy before
long. Grateful as ever, with kindest greetings in the name

<p>The same idea is carried further in a letter received by one

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;Your printed report which came into my hands a few days
ago has made me very happy. I was not surprised, but it only
strengthened my belief in you and in the good of humanity.
What you have done and are still doing brings nearer the goal
that now seems so far off&mdash;everlasting peace grounded in
respect and mutual understanding.&#8221;</p></div>

<p class="newletter"><span class="smcap">The Relatives of Men in Ruhleben.</span></p>

<p>When in April of last year, after repeated applications by
us, regular visits by the wives and children were at last
permitted, the regulations were at first rather strict. The
separation of husband and wife by a table was felt to be a
special hardship.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The visits taking a satisfactory course,
however, this was altered in a few weeks, and since then
visitors have been allowed in the camp itself and may walk
around and converse freely with their relatives. Permission
was, indeed, soon extended to mothers and sisters, and also
fianc&eacute;es of those interned, provided the engagement had taken
place before internment. At the present time wives living in
and around Berlin are allowed to visit once a month, the time
permitted being nominally one hour, but this is fortunately
not interpreted very strictly, so that in actual practice two
hours are often allowed. Wives coming from a distance receive
permission every three months; and it was for a long time a
concern of these women and of their husbands&mdash;a concern
shared by us&mdash;that these visits had to be made in a single
period of two hours. Over and over again one found that the
joy of reunion after so long a separation was so unnerving that
they could scarcely unburden themselves on a single occasion
of all the important matters reserved for discussion, and that
only afterwards did they remember all that they had intended
to say. We repeatedly made representations on this score in
the proper quarter, appealing for a change in the regulation,
and in December last we had the joy of obtaining permission
for the wives from outside to stay in Berlin for a week and
to make two visits of two hours during this period. In special
cases a third visit might be allowed. All wives coming from
a distance, at the same time as they receive the permit, are
instructed by the Commandant to apply to us in the event of
their needing any advice in respect of accommodation in
Berlin. And so we are visited by many, whose reception in
Berlin we either arrange for at their request in advance, or
who, though acquainted with Berlin, yet come for information.
They are so well satisfied with the conditions of their visits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>that at the present time there is no occasion to ask for further
concessions.</p>


<p class="newletter"><span class="smcap">Getting Men Out of Ruhleben.</span></p>

<p>Apart from our interest in the repatriation of the &#8220;over
forty-fivers,&#8221; our principal concern for Ruhleben consists for
the present in finding work outside the camp for the younger
prisoners, for, thanks to the recent decision of the Commandant,
resulting from our repeated applications, such
prisoners may obtain leave of absence provided they find
situations. It is, of course, very difficult for those in the
camp to seek situations, and we are therefore making special
efforts to find opportunities for work, induce employers to
engage an alien, and then conduct negotiations. There are
among those desiring to exchange their forced idleness at
Ruhleben for productive work many who are concerned to
remain loyal British subjects.</p></div>

<p>The following quotation from Dr. Rotten refers to a specially
interesting intercommunication:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>We are delighted and thankful to see from your letter of
January 31 that an unnamed gentleman in America has sent
you the sum of &pound;400 with instructions to assign half of it to
our work for foreigners in Germany, and saying that the
British Government at once gave their consent to the payment
of the amount to us. It will be a great help to our work and
will be conscientiously used for British subjects and for the
subjects of nations allied with England. For a considerable
time our work has been such that we can take advantage of
the relief agencies of other countries for the assistance of
Germans abroad, and for that reason can apply the means
placed at our disposal for the support of foreigners in Germany
only. So our help is now practically confined to &#8220;alien
enemies,&#8221; because the subjects of neutral States, should they
be in need, can obtain other assistance, and it is our uppermost
wish to relieve those who, but for us, would perhaps be
utterly friendless. It is, moreover, a great satisfaction and
encouragement to us that outside your and our spheres the
community of our work is so strongly felt that people desire
to further the efforts of the two societies simultaneously. The
confidence so kindly felt in our efforts even abroad incites us
to an ever increasing devotion to our work, to the undertaking
of new tasks, and to the fulfilling of the old ones with
more and more care in every detail.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Spectroscope Story.</span></h3>

<p>The spectroscope story is a particularly good
example of the way reprisals of good work out. I take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>the following account from a leaflet signed W.R.H.,
and already known to many workers in the cause of
fellowship.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A spectroscope, I believe, is an instrument which takes a
ray of light and proceeds to spread it abroad. At all events,
the description seems to suit in this case.</p>

<p>The spectroscope game was started by Bishop Bury. After
his return from his visit to Ruhleben Camp he mentioned in
a lecture that some of the science students interned there were
very anxious to obtain the use of a spectroscope. The report
of this lecture was read by one of the camp visitors of the
Friends&#8217; Emergency Committee, who was a schoolmaster and
a scientist. Moreover, he possessed a spectroscope. So he
joined in the game and played his piece. But instead of trying
to send the instrument to Germany, he wrote to St. Stephen&#8217;s
House and suggested that inquiries should be made as to
whether any of the schools in the internment camps in England
were in need of such an apparatus. If so, he would lend his,
and ask our friends of the Berlin Committee for assisting alien
enemies to try to do the same for Ruhleben. It was soon
discovered that a group of men in Douglas Camp would welcome
the spectroscope, which was at once sent them, and the
corresponding message written to Berlin. It was not long
before a reply was received telling us, as we expected, that
every effort would be made, as usual, to carry out such a
proposal for reciprocal service to prisoners.</p>

<p>A little later another player came into the game in the
shape of the German War Office. (There seems to be a War
Office player in every game that takes place in these days.)
The German War Office was reluctant to permit valuable
lenses to enter the internment camp without being quite sure
first of all that the corresponding privilege had been allowed
in England. Would we, therefore, obtain and forward a
written certificate from the Commandant of the camp to say
that the instrument had been allowed. This was soon done,
and we next hear that the Berlin Committee, being unable
to find a spectroscope themselves, had collected the sum of 900
marks for the purchase of one, and has asked permission for
two of the leaders of the &#8220;University&#8221; of Ruhleben to be
allowed out of camp to inspect instruments before purchase.
This permission seems to have been readily granted, and Dr.
Higgins and Mr. Chadwick met Dr. Rotten, the secretary of
the Berlin Committee, in order to choose the most suitable
apparatus. They finally decided upon one offered by Herr H.,
the head of an optical instrument firm.</p>

<p>At this point the game became specially interesting. Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Rotten was aware that Herr H.&#8217;s brother and his family
had been closely in touch with the Emergency Committee, and
had received considerable help in difficult and distressing
circumstances. In recognition of the assistance given to his
brother, he at once offered to lend to the camp, for the period
of the war, a spectrometer and prisms valued together at
1,650 marks. The 900 marks collected were thus released to
be used for other enterprises. Herr H. also sent a warm
message offering to receive his brother&#8217;s children, who had
lost their mother during the war, and to welcome his brother
as soon as he was free to cross to Germany. He also offered to
provide him with anything he might desire to help him pass
away the weary hours in camp. We learnt that the brother
had been studying French, and now wish to take up Spanish,
and he has therefore chosen a set of Spanish instruction books
as what he would like best.</p>

<p>The game still continues. Other well-known scientific firms
in Berlin have been approached and interested in an effort
to provide material for scientific work in Ruhleben, and we
have received a request from Dr. Higgins to follow up an
effort he is making to provide similar assistance for some men
at Knockaloe, about whom he has written to various
University professors and business friends in England. Herr
H. has also sent us a list of nine firms whose principals he
is acquainted with, to see if they also will help in like
manner.</p>

<p>A spectroscope I believe, is an instrument which takes a
ray of light and proceeds to spread it abroad. A fine
instrument!</p>

<p class="signature">W.R.H.</p>
</div>

<p>The ray of light is spread by reprisals of good. When
the nephew of a friend of mine was let out from
Ruhleben on a fortnight&#8217;s leave, and received &#8220;overwhelming
kindness&#8221; from his German hosts, what
was it that so specially drew out their kindness? The
fact that their own son, interned in this country, has
been befriended here. (P. 105.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Baby Case Visitor.</span></h3>

<p>Yet, in spite of all the efforts of sympathy, suffering,
in camp and out, grows ever greater as the war continues.
Here are two short stories of February, 1915,
as reported to the Committee on this side. If, for a
moment we can forget our passions, the sufferings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>these, our fellows, must touch our hearts. Nearly four
more years have passed and we know that greater
loneliness and sorrow must have come to these hearts,
as to so many more.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Our first call is in a horrid little street off Tottenham Court
Road. Four knocks on a very shaky door brings Bertha, the
wife of a German, a ships&#8217; cook, who has never been long
enough on shore to become a naturalised Englishman. Bertha
was a servant for many years before she married, and had
collected many precious possessions, and she and Friedrich
had a comfortable home with plenty of furniture and full of
all the useless and hideous knicknack which apparently make
so many people happy. Only a few remain, for nearly all have
&#8220;had to go&#8221;&mdash;the term we know so well to mean that they
are now in pawn, and that it will probably never be possible
to redeem them. When first we visited them they were living
in a basement room where rats made it difficult for them to
sleep, and where, on the many unexpected calls I paid, I
never once found a fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not people wot feel the cold like some, Miss,&#8221; they
told me; &#8220;and the room&#8217;s so small it likely wouldn&#8217;t be
&#8217;ealthy to have a fire all day&#8221; so the &#8220;bit of washing&#8221;
used to hang on a string for days and days before it dried,
and they did their &#8220;bit of cooking&#8221; on a small gas ring.
One day I called and found Friedrich still in bed; he was
quite well, he said, &#8220;but we take turns to stay in bed, Miss,
for it&#8217;s warmer there and you don&#8217;t seem to feel so hungry
in bed as when you&#8217;re up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were trying to save something out of a weekly
12s. 6d., after 6s. had been paid for rent, for the time when
Bertha would have to go into hospital, and to buy some
clothes that her little babe would need. Then <i>you sent me</i>,
and let me tell her you would remember her when that time
came, and you sent her flannel and wool to make the little
clothes: after that a shilling a week could be spent on coals,
and each time I went they sent you thanks and blessed you
for your love.</p>

<p>We say good-bye here and go north to Camden Town where
we call on Ludwig and Marie and their five children, the eldest
of whom is six. He is Austrian and she is Irish, and they
live in two rooms for which they pay 8s. 6d. a week. He
was a waiter for thirteen years in a well known London
restaurant, and his master has told him many times he would
take him back if only the public or the newspapers would
let him. But <i>they won&#8217;t</i>. So Ludwig had nothing to do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>and tells me he thinks he shall go out of his mind sitting in
idleness in his miserable surroundings. Marie has been in
hospital, too, and then Ludwig <i>had</i> plenty to do looking after
his four little children alone for two weeks, and says it
was the hardest work he ever had to do, and is glad his lot
in life is not to be a woman!</p>

<p>The doctor in the hospital told Marie she must have plenty
of milk every day, and we smiled together, for we knew
their weekly income left no margin for milk for her&mdash;the
children must be fed first. So <i>you</i> are helping, and Marie
has her milk each day, and she and her babe are growing
strong and well again.</p></div>

<p>The work done by the Friends&#8217; Emergency Committee,
Dr. K.&nbsp;E. Markel and others on this side,
and by Dr. Rotten, Siegmund Schulze, Prof.
Stange and their fellows on the other, is indeed as &#8220;a
clear flame of truth in a dark and haunted night.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prof. Stange.</span></h3>

<p>To the great work of Prof. Stange, of G&ouml;ttingen, I
have once or twice alluded. He directs all the instruction
given in the G&ouml;ttingen camp, attends daily, gives
lectures and superintends the library. He experienced
the usual difficulties of any civilian who tries to practice
Christianity in war-time. &#8220;One great German
newspaper wrote with indignation that the prisoners
in the G&ouml;ttingen Camp had as good a time as if they
were at a health resort.&#8221; Doubtless this paper, like
some others, contrasted the (rumoured) abominable
treatment of German prisoners by their enemies with
the too great indulgence shown to prisoners in Germany.
But Prof. Stange is not abashed. &#8220;No internment
camp,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;can be compared with a
&#8216;holiday resort.&#8217; In spite of everything that may be
done for the prisoners, internment is and remains
always a very hard lot. In the G&ouml;ttingen camp, too,
many a prisoner needs not only the exertion of his
whole strength, but help as well to make the endurance
of his lot physically and spiritually possible.&#8221; Stange
is one of those who have learned to envisage the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>anxieties, the loneliness, the uncertainty, the ennui
of the prisoner, and the terrible enervation of long
months, and, alas, years of confinement. In this, as
in so many circumstances of the war, it is the more
sensitive and developed minds that suffer most, and
are most easily destroyed, those minds that are indispensable
in the building of any worthy future.</p>

<p>Prof. Stange quite frankly acknowledges to a war
prejudice against the English. But when he found
their great need of help, his prejudices melted away,
and he soon engaged in helping them too with books
classes, and other means of activity.</p>

<p>Prof. Stange recognises that such work for enemy
prisoners helps towards better treatment of their own
prisoners abroad, but, he adds, &#8220;It must certainly be
emphatically stated that we in G&ouml;ttingen never took
up our work for the prisoners with this object. What
compelled us to work was simply and entirely the
great distress and need of the prisoners themselves.&#8221;
(P. 36. The extracts are from Prof. Stange&#8217;s
pamphlet on G&ouml;ttingen Camp.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Last Resting Place.</span></h3>

<p>At last, rest. To many weary hearts it must have
become a pitiful consolation that this at least is sure.
&#8220;After life&#8217;s fitful fever he sleeps well.&#8221; And in that
sleep no fevered passion can even &#8220;ruffle one corner of
the folded shroud.&#8221; At last, rest; where the enmities
and the ambitions are forgotten. In the presence of
this stillness of death, even to the living their disputes
seem small. If the mood could endure, death might
not be needed to bring peace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">I.&mdash;England.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;In a corner of the bonny little churchyard of
Frongoch, adjoining the extended camp, there are two
solitary graves. Here, in a strange land, the land of
their captivity, two German prisoner soldiers lie at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>rest, as in many a plot of ground in France and
Flanders, German and British lie together, strife
hushed in the last sleep. Here there are no grim
sounds and sights of battle, but instead there is all the
peace and beauty of a lovely spring. Immediately
beyond the graves a wooded bank descends to the
stream, and over and through the fresh green foliage,
amidst which the birds are happily melodious this
bright April morning, and all around can be seen the
mountains of Wales, the &#8216;land of freedom.&#8217; Over the
grave of one of these liberated captives is a tombstone
erected at the expense of, and engraved by, his fellow
prisoners. It marks the place where Hugo Schr&ouml;ter,
Under-Officer of one of the Crown Prince&#8217;s Infantry
Regiments, who died on April 9, 1915, as the result of
wounds received in the cause of his country, was laid
to rest by his grateful comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other grave has no stone as yet, but one is
being prepared. It is that of a prisoner who died of
consumption, after many months of lingering suffering
in the hospital, where every care was bestowed upon
him. It was in reference to this man that the Chief
Officer wrote me: &#8216;To our regret died last Thursday
the patient in the isolation hospital. If only he could
have seen the two beautiful bunches of violets you
sent! The funeral took place yesterday at 10-30. It
was an impressive sight but a very sad one, too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter laid a little offering of white flowers
on the grave, and then I photographed them in order
to send copies to the families of the poor men, which
I hope may prove little winged messengers of
sympathy and goodwill.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II.&mdash;Germany.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;A British officer, of whom one can truly say that
he had not been afraid to speak the truth about his
treatment in Germany, and in the Cologne hospital,
was carried to his last resting-place yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Captain Wilfred Beckett Birt, of the East
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Surrey Regiment No. 31, who, on the occasion of the
attack in September, 1915, had his thigh shattered
and was taken prisoner. Since January, 1916, he had
been nursed in the fortress hospital, No. 6, situated in
the Empress Augusta School. His chivalrous character
and his conscientious impartiality made him
respected and popular with his French and English
fellow sufferers and the German Hospital Staff.
Gratefully he acknowledged what the surgical art of
assistant-surgeon Dr. Meyer had done to lessen his
sufferings, and the loving care the German nurses,
male and female, had bestowed on him and his
comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great affection in which he was held by friend
and foe alike showed itself in the mourning over his
death, which took place a few days ago. His wound,
a short time before, had shown improvement, but the
heart was no longer equal to the terrible strain. Those
of his comrades who were not confined to bed rallied
round his coffin yesterday, which had been put upon a
bier in the hospital garden surrounded by flowers and
palms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal mourners were his countrymen, who
were seated on benches at the foot of the coffin; around
it were the French and Belgians, the German doctors
and hospital staff. Large lighted candles stood at the
head of the coffin, which was covered with wreaths
decorated with the English, French, Belgian, and
German colours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Garrison Pastor Hartmann, in a moving speech,
which went straight to the heart of the hearers, spoke
about the deceased as a chivalrous fighter for his
native land, as a good Christian and a truly noble
character. It was touching to hear the parting hymn
sung by the sonorous voices of the British wounded,
accompanied solemnly on the harmonium by a British
performer. All escorted the coffin to the gates. Once
outside, it was reverently lifted on to the funeral car,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>which German gunners escorted to the cemetery.
Four British and one French officer, as well as the
German doctors who could be spared, followed in motor
cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the gates of the cemetery, Lieutenant-General
Schach, Colonel Lindemann, as representative of the
Governor of the fortress, Major Esser, Dr. Lamberts,
the chief medical officer of the garrison, deputations
of the Officers&#8217; and Medical Corps, the Band of the
Reserve Battalion Pioneer Regiment No. 25, awaited
the cort&egrave;ge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pastor Hartmann spoke again, and, in words
which made a deep impression on all, closed with
prayer and benediction. Dr. Rademacher, the
Catholic priest of the garrison, then made a funeral
oration in English, affecting all who heard it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of the hospital staff, Dr. Meyer
expressed his heartfelt sorrow to the British officers
present, the band played the hymn, &#8216;How gently they
rest, those who are with the Lord,&#8217; and, profoundly
touched, Englishmen and Frenchmen shook hands
with the clergy and the German officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three handfuls of earth on to the coffin of one who
had found eternal rest, and the mourners dispersed.&#8221;

WHAT THE GERMAN MAY BE.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Witness from Serbia.</span></h3>


<p>The following letter may not inappropriately open
this section. Dr. Ella Scarlett-Synge is the daughter
of the third Baron Abinger. She has a long medical
experience, and served by Government appointment
with Mrs. Fawcett on the Concentration Camps Commission
in the Boer War. Dr. Scarlett-Synge was
present in Serbia during the Austro-German invasion,
she was in Germany afterwards and visited various
prisoners&#8217; camps. On her return she wrote the brief
letter which follows. Of her <i>bona fides</i> there was no
doubt, and she had introductions to various
editors. Yet only one daily paper (<i>The Manchester
Guardian</i>) would publish her letter. This is a small
illustration of the methods of war-time. Belligerent
nations manage to convince themselves that by suppression
of disconcerting evidence one arrives at truth.
It is easy to understand, for all of us who are frank
with ourselves know the difficulty of complete fairness
even in ordinary controversy. But the consequences
of arguing for mere victory are in war sometimes as
grave and sad as the consequences of fighting for mere
victory. Dr. Synge tells us simply what she saw:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Having just returned from Serbia, via Berlin, I have one
great wish, the desire to bring home to my own country the
things that I have seen with my own eyes, and the truths
that I have personally realised.</p>

<p>After the South African War, I was a doctor in Canada
for ten years and when, during the second year of this war,
the call came from Serbia for doctors, I was one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>responding, and was stationed by the Serbian Government
as Medical Officer of Health for Batochina and district,
where I was in residence at the time of the German invasion
in October, and was with my wounded men when the German
army entered northern Serbia, and saw the whole campaign.</p>

<p>Contrary to all my expectations, the conduct of the German
army was excellent in every respect. The men entered
no occupied house without the permission of the owner, they
took nothing without payment or a requisition paper. Never
did I ask a German soldier in vain for half of his bread for
a wounded Serbian soldier. Generally it was all given to
me and I cut the portion and returned half.</p>

<p>After I had been for some weeks with the German Red
Cross doctors and began to realise how wrong an impression
all in England had concerning our enemies, I decided to ask
permission to go to Germany and see for myself whether
equally wrong ideas existed concerning the treatment of
British prisoners in the detention camps. This permission
was accorded me, and I went to Berlin where I waited a
fortnight while the War Office decided upon the matter. I
was then given a long list of camps to choose from and permitted
to go with an officer to inspect and report upon the
same.</p>

<p>In this short letter I can only say that I was justified in
my belief that all was well with our men, and, as a fine
Canadian sergeant at Giessen said to me (whose regiment
I had seen march out of Vancouver a year ago), &#8220;If a man
behaves himself, he will have nothing to complain of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, to my sorrow, I am forced to confess that the nations
do not yet incline towards peace, and to my regret I have
to state that Germany&#8217;s resources at the present drain will
last another four or five years. Also there is no lack of
food, and one may also say of luxuries in the land. The
people are united to fight as long as England wishes to continue
in the useless struggle in which neither can win, for
while we hold the sea, they are equally powerful on land.
I can see that this is going to be a drawn war, but neither
nation has yet had enough.</p>

<p>The object of this letter is not to encourage a premature
peace which would be ultimately worse than war, but to
plead for a fairer treatment for our foe. Let the truth,
and the truth only, be known. &#8220;Let us fight if we must
fight&mdash;but not with lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one, in time of peace, respects the British Press more
than I do. It is the greatest power in the land. And, let me
to-day appeal to that mighty influence for weal or for woe,
according to whether it decides wisely or not, to play the
game fairly and let the same spirit prevail that we have in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>our great public schools: &#8220;win if you can&mdash;but only by fair
play.&#8221;&mdash;I beg to remain, Yours faithfully, <span class="smcap">Ella Scarlett-Synge</span>,
M.D., D.P.H.</p>

<p>Hyde Park Hotel, Knightsbridge.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Scarlett-Synge was, at the outset, intensely
anti-German. Her personal experience of Germans
(both military and civilian) in war-time has profoundly
modified her views. Dr. Scarlett-Synge went
out from Canada to take over a position as Medical
Officer of Health in the north of Serbia. She had
twelve villages under her care, and found the absolute
lack of sanitation or sanitary knowledge in that country
very trying. At the time of the invasion, Dr. Synge
was strongly urged to leave, but decided to stop with
her wounded men. Strangely enough the only soldiers
from whom she had to flee were the Serbians. The
Serbian Army in its retreat through Batochina was
absolutely drunk, officers as well as men, and while
the soldiers were forcing the doors of the priest&#8217;s
house, where Dr. Synge resided, she fled with the
priest&#8217;s wife (at the latter&#8217;s terror-struck entreaty)
through a back window. The house was rifled by the
soldiers, and next day the German patrol arrived. Dr.
Synge was asked by the sergeant to assure the people
of Batochina that if there was no shooting, they would
be perfectly safe. She was urged to collect any firearms,
and the patrol then withdrew. The doctor, with
the help of the people, collected 17 rifles. There was,
however, one obstinate Serbian soldier who had
apparently not been able to keep up with the retreat,
who threatened to retain his rifle, and seemed quite
capable of endangering the whole population. &#8220;Your
thumb needs attention, does it not?&#8221; asked the
doctor. &#8220;Just let me look at it?&#8221; The man opened
his hand and she snatched his rifle away. A joyful
crowd accompanied her with the rifle to the dispensary,
where it was locked up.</p>

<p>Had there been firing by the populace, there would
undoubtedly have been reprisals. Our own action in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>the Boer War, and the action of the military in <i>every</i>
invasion, illustrates this fundamental rule. As it was,
there was absolutely no destruction and the soldiers
were scrupulously honest. When the owners had fled,
their houses and their cattle were certainly made use
of, but whenever the owner was present the soldiers
&#8220;were not allowed to touch a single thing.&#8221; The
exception proves the rule; Dr. Scarlett-Synge&#8217;s hostess
had her pig stolen, but a German soldier caught her
an unowned pig of larger size. She was very pleased
with the exchange!</p>

<p>&#8220;May we use your schoolhouse for our wounded?&#8221;
said the German doctors, &#8220;it seems the best place.&#8221;
Dr. Scarlett-Synge was amazed. She had expected
anything but this kind of politeness. Only <i>once</i> in
her three months&#8217; experience of the Germans was she
treated rudely, and that was by an extremely anti-English
doctor of the Deutsche Kriegshospital No. 58,
Belgrade. This particular man corresponded to a
certain type of anti-German here, and a private soldier
present afterwards apologised for his rudeness.</p>

<p>The Serbians shelled Batochina, and so killed some
of their own people. While the doctor was passing
through the streets, some German soldiers beckoned
her to take shelter in a caf&eacute; where they were. This
she ultimately did. &#8220;I could not have had more
consideration shown me,&#8221; she averred. One little
incident is singularly expressive. One of the Germans
had bought a glass of brandy. Dr. Scarlett-Synge,
with the picture of drunken soldiery very vivid in her
remembrance, ventured to remonstrate. She pointed
out to the man what the Serbians had become under
the influence of drink. He said nothing, but presently
he got up and threw the brandy out of the door.
&#8220;There&#8217;s not much good in that stuff, anyway,&#8221; he
said. It is not surprising that after such experiences
the doctor was puzzled at the ordinary British view
of the German army. &#8220;How do you account for these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>lies?&#8221; she asked a Bavarian soldier. &#8220;Ah, without
lies there would be no war,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In her travels in Germany Dr. Scarlett-Synge
experienced uniform kindness, and brought away with
her a deep conviction of the self-sacrificing patriotism
of the German people. &#8220;Moreover,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I
was able to express my views to them, and they were
always listened to with tolerance and courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>I give Dr. Scarlett-Synge&#8217;s experiences as she
describes them. Of her own honesty and accuracy
there can be no question. It may be said, with reason,
that there is another side. Dr. Scarlett-Synge came
across the better German and the better Germany.
The important fact is that the better Germany exists,
and that those who have been in Germany since the
war began have found that better element conspicuous.
This is much to say for a country at war.</p>

<p>In case Dr. Ella Scarlett-Synge&#8217;s testimony is
thought to need confirmation, I may add the following
from a private letter:&mdash;&#8220;Dr. A.P. was interned in
Serbia for some months with about thirty other doctors
and nurses. She sent to me over twelve months since
saying she would like to be of some use to German
prisoners in this country, as a slight return for the
consideration and kindness shown by Germans and
Austrians whom she had to do with while in Serbia.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Witness from France.</span></h3>

<p>Madame F.&nbsp;L. Cyon was at Lille when it was taken
by the Germans, and spent some time there nursing
during the German occupation. Madame Cyon&#8217;s
general experiences are printed in an appendix at the
end of this volume, but she has given me some further
details which are worth recording. I think they will
serve to bring out the universal facts of human nature.
From her mother, Madame D&mdash;&mdash; she heard the
particulars of her father&#8217;s arrest. One of the officers
who arrested M. D&mdash;&mdash; was ungentlemanly and rough,
the others were polite. The house was searched.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>Later a second military search was made, the officers
on that occasion being most polite, and apologising for
the trouble they caused. As he was leaving, the chief
officer said to Mme. D&mdash;&mdash;, &#8220;We shall carry away
with us the memory of your house as a house of peace
and quietness, and of you as a very brave woman.&#8221;
After her husband&#8217;s arrest, Madame D&mdash;&mdash; asked for
permission to take meals to him, and this was accorded
without any demur. One day later the officer just
mentioned crossed the street to speak to her. &#8220;I want
to bring you some good news,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the release
of your husband is only a matter of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. D&mdash;&mdash; was at Maubeuge at the time of his arrest.
When he and others were brought back to Maubeuge
for trial they got drenched with rain on the way, and
were put for that night in the old prison, which was
dilapidated and without fire. M. D&mdash;&mdash; complained
next day. The officer to whom he complained apologised
and said their imprisonment under these conditions
was entirely a mistake. During most of his
imprisonment M. D&mdash;&mdash; lived on the food provided,
which he described as good, but not plentiful. Two
fellow prisoners complained, and were allowed to get
food from outside. As narrated in the appendix,
M. D&mdash;&mdash; was released when it was found that there
was nothing against him. He had indeed been indiscreet
in order to meet the wishes of another, but that
was all. After his release he was engaged professionally
in forwarding the repairs at Maubeuge,
and was repeatedly in touch with the German
authorities, with whom he found it quite possible to
work.</p>

<p>For some time Madame D&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s house had guards
posted outside. There was on one occasion an
unpleasant incident with a drunken soldier who came
and demanded wine. A sergeant who came along,
however, promptly collared the man and turned him
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>It is fair to add that the long German occupation,
with its many requisitions and high-handed interference,
has embittered M.&nbsp;D. His wife, however,
remains quite unembittered. In spite of all the
demands, &#8220;She seemed to think that, apart from one
or two exceptions, the Germans in occupation behaved
very much as any army in such circumstances would
have done. Indeed, she added that when the English
arrived, some of them were so impertinent ...
that people thought that they used to get on better
with the Germans.&#8221; I have quoted part of the last
clause, as it seems fair to do so. For me it illustrates
the general experience that the <i>present</i> discomfort
tends by its vividness to seem greater than past discomforts
which were really equally great.</p>

<p>One other remark of Mme. D. should be quoted:
&#8220;I have seen many of the Germans, their doctors for
instance, look after the poor and the sick with utter
devotion.&#8221; I have, by request, omitted personal
names, except that of Madame Cyon herself.</p>

<p>At the occupation of Lille the Germans at once set
about extinguishing fires that had broken out. In
order to prevent these spreading, it was necessary to
blow up some houses, and the Germans posted bills
telling the people not to be alarmed at the explosions.
When Madame Cyon returned to England a newspaper-reporter
interviewed her. She stipulated that
she must see the manuscript before the interview was
published, and as she found the tone of the manuscript
was not hers, she refused to let it be printed. A later
interview with someone else was published in the
same newspaper, in which it was made to appear that
the Germans had deliberately set fire to the town.
This Madame Cyon asserts is directly contrary to the
facts. A similar case of exaggeration Madame Cyon
noticed while in the occupied districts. There were
all kinds of dreadful stories as to what went on about
the country, and she was told it would never do to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>leave Lille. When she did leave, and made her way
to Holland, she found no confirmation of these stories.
Travelling was uncomfortable and tedious, but there
was no peril of any kind.</p>

<p>In the early days of the war there were Belgian
refugees at Alexandra Palace. M. Cyon was a
journalist, and took his notebook with him to put down
interesting facts. He wished to confine himself to
facts, however, which not all journalists do. He
found the women full of stories about atrocities, but
they were always terrible things that had happened to
<i>someone else</i>. The student of war atrocities indeed
finds this to be a very general feature of the stories
told. It by no means follows that atrocities do not
occur. Certainly they do, but the number undergoes
extraordinary exaggeration in the excited minds of the
people. M. Cyon, therefore, as a serious observer,
asked for one person who could speak at first hand.
One of the refugees, he was told, was a woman whose
little boy had been branded on both cheeks by the
Germans. He was directed to this woman. He asked
for her experiences, but she had nothing startling to
tell. &#8220;But,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;was not your little boy
very badly treated by the Germans?&#8221; &#8220;Little boy!&#8221;
she exclaimed, in astonishment, &#8220;I have no little
boy, I have no son at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Cyon had various patients at Lille. Her
24 Germans, she told me, gave her no more trouble
than any ordinary patients. She had, however, four
French Moroccan soldiers to nurse, and she describes
them as extremely savage. She was sometimes afraid
of them, and of one especially.</p>

<p>Madame Cyon was often overworked, and patients
are not always reasonable. One evening she brought
her German patients some mutton stew, and one of
the wounded men made a dissatisfied remark about it.
Madame Cyon was feeling very tired and the remark
hurt her. She remained outside in the corridor instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>of coming to the men as usual during their meal.
Presently one man who had acted as interpreter came
out. &#8220;Madame, you are cross.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;
&#8220;Why are you cross?&#8221; &#8220;The men have been well
treated, I have done all I could, and now they grumble
about nothing.&#8221; The man was very sorry, he went
back, and presently all who could walk came out and
apologised. How strangely alike, after all, we human
beings are! But our rulers could never lead us out in
armies to kill each other unless they persuaded us
somehow that we only were wonderfully fine chaps,
and the others were brutes. Yet the appeal of kindness
and devotion tells everywhere. So when the
German science student, Albin Claus, mentioned in
Madame Cyon&#8217;s account (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_262">262</a>), found her much overworked,
he said, &#8220;You go to sleep, and I will keep
watch,&#8221; and he helped in all ways to keep things right.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have since written to the same science student,&#8221;
writes Madame Cyon; &#8220;before leaving the hospital
he asked my address and I his. He told me he would
always be glad to help me in any way, as he knew that
I had five brothers in the French army. At the time
one of my brothers was missing. I wrote to this man,
then promoted a Lieutenant, and I had two letters
from him via Switzerland. The correspondence was
concerning my brother, and Lieutenant V.&nbsp;R. Albin
Claus did his best to help me, and spoke in his letters
of his stay in hospital 105, thanking me for my care.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Another Sort of Witness.</span></h3>

<p>The soldier on both sides has been told all sorts of
horrors about the enemy. Hatred is recognised as a
great weapon of destruction. The contrast between
what the soldier has seen and what he has heard is
well illustrated by a story told by Mr. John Buchan
in one of his lectures. A wounded Scot had said to
him, of the Germans, &#8220;They&#8217;re a bad, black lot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span><i>but no the men opposite us</i>. They were a very
respectable lot, and grand fechters.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times</i>, April

<h3><span class="smcap">War Zone Children.</span></h3>

<p>Under the heading &#8220;War Zone Children,&#8221; the
following paragraph appeared in the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i> of the 30th November, 1915:</p>

<p>The Society of Friends&#8217; Emergency Committee for
Aliens has just received the following letter from Dr.
Elisabeth Rotten, of Berlin (before the war lecturer
at Newnham College, Cambridge), showing that the
German committee for helping alien enemies in distress
is not behind similar committees in this country
in looking after the little ones belonging to enemy
countries:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="date">30/11/15.</p>

<p>Before I leave Switzerland, after a short visit, I should
like to write you a few lines.</p>

<p>I have been ten days in Belgium in order to get permission
to take Belgian and French children home to their parents,
who had left them in the occupied country before the outbreak
of war and were now living in France or in other
foreign parts.</p>

<p>I was also to bring the first little group with me myself.
Others will be fetched during the next weeks by other ladies
of our committee. We spent the night in Frankfurt in the
houses of German ladies, who are already looking forward to
their future little guests. The whole expedition will belong
to one of the pleasantest peace remembrances of the war,
and it was a particular pleasure and benefit to me to see and to
experience personally in the work of my mission, in how
many directions and with what sincerely good and noble intentions
the Governor General endeavours to mitigate personal
suffering, and particularly how he cares for the children who
are separated from their parents.</p>

<p>I hope soon to write more. The children will now be taken
to their parents by Swiss ladies, and I am on the point of
starting for Frankfurt, where there are many important
points to discuss with the Committee for Advice and Aid
in connection with our common work.</p></div>

<p>The last-named committee is a local Frankfort

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span><span class="smcap">A Soldier and the Children.</span></h3>

<p>Here is a German N.C.O. writing in <i>Vorw&auml;rts</i> of
some experiences in the Russian occupied territory:</p>

<p>He describes the poverty of the people, the lack of
even such necessaries of life as salt, boots, etc.; how
little children are running about in the snow with bare
feet, and often with no other garment on them than a
shirt. He adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>On the whole, however, the children give me great joy,
though also not a little annoyance owing to their importunity.
Fortunately, during my activity in connection with the
school children&#8217;s gymnastic society at &mdash;&mdash; I have gained so
much patience that I never permit myself to lose my temper.
While I am writing this already ten or twelve children have
invaded my room asking for bread. Everyone of them got
something. I am now almost reduced to beggary myself, and
whatever I can get hold of is given to the children, so that
they may enjoy themselves. I got from a friend a few
packets of ginger cakes. I gave them all away, and I do not
even know how they tasted.</p>

<p>And when I show them photographs of my children&#8217;s
gymnastic society there is almost a riot. How I wish I could
understand them better! A little girl of 13, who always
reminds me of my own second daughter, has won my heart completely.
Every day she says to me a couple of German
words which she has picked up somewhere: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
&#8220;Potatoes without salt are no good,&#8221; &#8220;Benzine is dangerous,&#8221;
and phrases like that. I cannot realise that these children
belong to an enemy nation. I should have dearly loved to
roam about with them through forest and field, as I used to
in Berlin.&mdash;(Quoted in the <i>Daily News</i>, December 20, 1915.)<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Child in No Man&#8217;s Land.</span></h3>

<p>The story of the child adopted by the Bedfordshires
will be remembered by many. She was found in a
ditch by the men on their way to the trenches, and
was perforce for some time with them there.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The German trenches were about 150 yards off, and the
level, open space between the two lines wasn&#8217;t healthy. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>man who valued his life would go there unnecessarily, or
recklessly put his head above the parapet. One morning,
to their horror the men, through the periscope, saw the
child standing above the trench on the German side. Cries
came from the enemy, but they were not hostile. The sight
of the girl, little more than an infant, has touched their
sentimental side, and she had offers of chocolate and invitations
to go and see them.</p>

<p>After that the girl went over the parapet quite often. She
was as safe in that danger zone as if she had been behind
the lines. No German would harm her, and once she went
close up to their first-line trench.&mdash;(<i>Daily News</i>, February 17,
1916).</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Austro-Hungarians in Cetinje.</span></h3>

<p>When the Austro-Hungarian troops entered Cetinje
there was already serious famine:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The children in the streets were begging bread from the
passing soldiers, who shared their tiny brown loaves with the
hungry little children, and the military authorities at the
barracks were besieged from the morning till late in the
evening by the starving population.</p>

<p>There were some fifty or sixty well-to-do better class
families, who had been in Government positions before, or
prominent business people, who suffered as terribly as their
poorer brethren. Among those who went begging for bread
to headquarters were wives of ex-Ministers and women who
were ladies-in-waiting at the Royal Court only a few weeks
previously. For their children&#8217;s sake they were all ready to
beg for something to eat.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the military authorities put the
soldiers on quarter rations and distributed all the available
food among the suffering population. The bad condition of
the roads and the consequent lack of supplies in the army
itself made it impossible for them to do more.&mdash;(<i>Daily News</i>,
February 21, 1916.)</p></div>

<p><i>On quarter rations</i>&mdash;that is worth remembering.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Not all Barbarians, nor All Chivalrous.</span></h3>

<p>We have all of us heard many stories from our
soldier friends. Many statements and opinions we
cannot in these days publish, but some are allowable.
Such as the following: &#8220;Some of our men were hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>up on the German barbed wire. We could do nothing
to get at them. We saw the Germans trying to make
signs from their trenches and we couldn&#8217;t at first
make out what they meant, but presently some of
them ventured out and took in our wounded. I
turned to my mate and said, &#8216;They tell us all the Germans
are barbarians, but that doesn&#8217;t look much like
it.&#8217; It was difficult to keep some of our men from
firing on the Germans even then.&#8221; The last statement
will surprise only those who have not been told
the truth about war. Passion gets the upper hand of
humanity, and indeed reason may support passion,
for is not destruction of the enemy one of the chief
aims of war? Shall we spare the enemy when rescuing
their <i>own</i> wounded? By war logic that would be
inconceivably foolish. Hence such incidents as the
following: A lieutenant of Hussars wrote on October
22, 1914, of his work in a loft which he had previously
loopholed. The letter is both frank and generous, and
as usual with soldiers&#8217; letters, without any of the
malicious sanctity which so besets the civilian. The
letter was published in the <i>Times</i>, November 26, 1914.
&#8220;When I got up I could see crowds of Germans advancing.
I think they have learnt a lesson from us,
for they didn&#8217;t advance in masses, but in extended
order like we do. They were jolly good, too....
One fellow was jolly brave. I saw him carrying back
a wounded man on his back, and it made a very good
target. Though we didn&#8217;t succeed in hitting him, he
had to drop his man.... We were having jolly good
fun.&#8221; One sentence shows how far removed are the
ethics of war from the ethics of peace: &#8220;I saw him
carrying back a wounded man on his back, <i>and it made
a very good target</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here is a case where chivalry was remembered
and forgotten. The extract is from the <i>Daily News</i>,
May 17, 1916. Most of us may get similar information
privately, but it is wisest to confine oneself to
what has already been published:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>A sergeant on active service writes in the course of a
letter on his experiences: &#8220;I got stuck in a trench up to
my waist in mud, and who do you think pulled me out?&mdash;only
a German about 6ft. 4in. One of my boys wanted to
bayonet him.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> I said: &#8216;Drop that or I shoot you.&#8217; The
German said: &#8216;Sergeant, it is not my fault&mdash;I am only fighting
for my country as you are fighting for yours.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">A German Priest.</span></h3>

<p>From the <i>Daily News</i>, February 17, 1916, I take the
following story of a German priest:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Then the word came that we were to go for the enemy&#8217;s
first line, and we did. Our artillery started the music, and we
made our effort.</p>

<p>Our lads almost lost their reason for the time being, and
heedless of shells and bullets, mounted the first German
parapet. We killed many of them, but it is fair to say they
didn&#8217;t give in. They quickly had reinforcements, and we
were compelled against heavy odds to yield the trench to
the enemy. Angry fighting continued, and our game now
was to lure as many of the Germans towards our lines as
possible so that we could mow them down with our guns. On
they came, many hundreds of them, and as quickly they fell.</p>

<p>Our fellows got it too, and one little party was absolutely
at the mercy of the enemy. Two of our young officers and
five men were severely wounded and their position was helpless,
for it was impossible to rescue them. Despite our
tremendous fire the Germans, with fixed bayonets, tried to
reach the party and their intention was obvious. They got
within a few yards of the wounded when one of their number
sprang in front of them and flashed a crucifix. &#8220;Stop,&#8221; he
shouted, and then he knelt down by the side of our men and
blessed them. The other Germans immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>Then we managed to reach the wounded and our officer
thanked the priest for the brave way in which he had
behaved in the face of his own men. &#8220;Take me,&#8221; said the
priest. &#8220;I am your prisoner.&#8221; The officer said he would
not do that, but he would see that he returned to the German
lines unharmed. The promise was kept, and before they
parted the priest, falling on his knees, thanked our officer
warmly, adding: &#8220;God bless you and good luck!&#8221;</p></div>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mutual Fears.</span></h3>

<p>Each side fears the barbarity of the other. &#8220;Would
it be good military policy,&#8221; asked a military official,
&#8220;to encourage any other idea?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;My comrades
were afraid,&#8217; said this German sergeant. &#8216;They cried
out to me that the Indians would kill their prisoners,
and that we should die if we surrendered. But I said,
&#8216;That is not true, comrades, and is only a tale. Let
us go forward with our hands up.&#8217; So in that way we
went, and the Indian horsemen closed about us, and I
spoke to one of them, asking for mercy for our men,
and he was very kind and a gentleman, and we
surrendered to him safely.&#8217; He was glad to be alive,
this man from Wiesbaden. He showed me the portrait
of his wife and boy, and cried a little, saying that the
German people did not make the war, but had to fight
for their country when told to fight, like other men....
He waved his hand back to the woodlands, and
remembered the terror of the place from which he had
just come. &#8216;Over there it was worse than death.&#8217;&#8221;
Yes, and &#8220;If any man were to draw the picture of
those things or to tell them more nakedly than I have
told them, because now is not the time, nor this the
place, no man or woman would dare to speak again of
war&#8217;s &#8216;glory,&#8217; or of &#8216;the splendour of war,&#8217; or any of
those old lying phrases which hide the dreadful truth.&#8221;
(Philip Gibbs in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, July 18, 1916.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Civilian&#8217;s Hate.</span></h3>

<p>Yet, appalling as modern war is, there are things
which some soldiers find worse. When I spoke to an
old friend of mine about a popular print that
disseminates hatred he said, &#8220;Whenever I see that
paper it makes my blood run cold.&#8221; Yet in one of the
charges which that man had faced only about a quarter
of his company came back. That charge was to him
less hideous than some newspaper malice&mdash;a malice
which is so often a matter of business. Since then my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>friend has given his life, and has left in one heart a
desolation that is worse than death. But in that heart
there is no hate, only sympathy for all the sorrow, both
on this side and the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Niven tells us the impressions of a
wounded soldier who saw the Zeppelin burned at
Cuffley. &#8220;What stuck in his mind was the roars that
occurred when the airship took fire and began to come
sagging and flaming down. &#8216;It reminded me of what I
have read of &#8220;Thumbs down&#8221; in the arenas of ancient
Rome. It was the most terrible thing I have heard in
my life. I&#8217;ve heard some cheering at the front, but
this was different. Nothing out there had quite the
same horrible sound.&#8217;&#8221; The difference can be
explained. &#8220;These men,&#8221; says Mr. Niven, &#8220;have
seen the procession of the maimed, grey propping
khaki, khaki propping grey, all trooping down to the
dressing station.&#8221; (<i>Daily News</i>, October 9, 1916.)</p>

<p>And here is a letter from a brave young officer, since
killed. &#8220;I drifted into the &mdash;&mdash; Parish Church last
evening to hear the organ and the singing. I was
pushed into a pew up in the front, and so could not
escape until the end of the service. I could have wept
when I heard the sermon; it was a dreadful medieval
picture of Heaven and Hell, and a dreadful curse on all
the German people as being ready for &#8216;Hell.&#8217; ...
The whole service was as artificial as one could imagine&mdash;so
heartless and so soulless. It made me feel so very
sad that, as I said before, I could have wept openly.
Do you think that the congregation, a large one, would
take in and believe all that they heard from the pulpit?
It seems too dreadful!&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">And Civilian Kindness.</span></h3>

<p>Yet even civilians, even German civilians, do not
always hate.</p>

<p>There is a better Germany, but it is only occasionally
that we are allowed glimpses of it now, and we must
go usually among unknown people, and read unpopular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>or comparatively obscure publications if we seek a
wider range of vision. In December, 1914, Mrs.
Jackson, wife of a golf professional, returned from
Germany to Clacton-on-Sea. Her husband had been
in the employ of the Cologne Golf Club. &#8220;Do you
think,&#8221; she was asked, &#8220;the German hatred of
England is general?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mrs. Jackson.
&#8220;Of course, the Germans hate England fiercely as a
nation, but I do not think they do as individuals.
Everyone treated us extremely well, although they
knew our nationality, and my husband&#8217;s employers are
anxious for him to go back again to them when the war
is finished.&#8221; &#8220;Does Germany know the truth?&#8221; &#8220;I
do not think so. We could not get any British newspapers,
and only heard the German side of the
question. I was quite thunderstruck when I heard
England had joined in, and I am sure the German
people were, too. The Germans are confident of victory,
and so much is this so that some of my friends did not
want me to go back, saying that I should be much
safer where I was.&#8221; I take this report from the
<i>Clacton Graphic</i> of February 20, 1915.</p>

<p>Of course, there has been much kindness on this
side, and much gratitude for it in Germany, but I
confess that some things I have heard from the other
side have given me twinges of patriotic jealousy. I
should like to feel that my country is always first
in generosity. When Chaplain O&#8217;Rorke walked
unattended and in khaki through the streets of Burg,
there was no offensive remark.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Three English ladies
travelling in Germany in war-time tell me that they
never suffered from one unpleasant word. Miss Littlefair
tells of some anti-English demonstrations, but of
far more kindness, and when her unpopular nationality
became known in a railway carriage, there was no
change in the friendliness of its occupants.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Again, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Canadian Chaplain has been allowed to travel free, and
in his uniform, and to visit his men in different camps.
He seems to have had no difficulty with the populace.
As regards walks on parole, we hear from Crefeld,
&#8220;There has been no trouble of any kind with the
inhabitants.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some German Newspapers and other German
Comments.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> is one of those German
newspapers which has often at least worked for sanity
in the national attitude. We may differ from some of
its conclusions, but we must admire its stand against
the flood of foolish, indiscriminate hate. On
February 27, 1915, it asked: &#8220;What sense is there
in German professors declaring that they will no longer
collaborate with this or that scientific institution in
England?... Salutations such as the celebrated
&#8216;God punish England&#8217; are not only fundamentally
tasteless and theatrical, but are quite ridiculous....
We are deep in war, and we have to collect all our
strength to beat our enemies, and especially to subdue
our most dangerous enemy, England; but after the war
must follow a peace which shall render possible calm
and assured work. This work must be performed in
conjunction with other peoples which we cannot exterminate.&#8221; ...
(Quoted in the <i>Times</i>, March 2, 1915.)
On April 11, 1915, there appeared another telling little
article, &#8220;English and German, according to Professor
Sombart.&#8221; The article is quietly ironical over Professor
Sombart, who brings us before the court on the
old charge, that we are a nation of shopkeepers. &#8220;The
traders&#8217; spirit, that is Englishdom.&#8221; I confess that
as an Englishman I have always felt there was an
uncomfortable amount of truth in this sneer. We are
surely a somewhat stodgy, money-making people with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>far too little receptivity for new ideas. &#8220;I have long
thought and preached,&#8221; wrote Lord Haldane in the
<i>Nation</i> of August 7, 1915, &#8220;that the real problem in this
country is the development of thought and ideas.&#8221;
Dr. Drill does not in his review concern himself with
this charge. He remarks in passing that it is quite
possible for a tradesman to be a hero and for a minister
of war to be a tradesman, and then goes on to point
out the futile absurdity of all such general charges. He
cites an amusing attack on German culture by a lecturer
at Bedford College. &#8220;We smile over his attack,&#8221;
says Dr. Drill. &#8220;May we not be afraid that educated
Englishmen do the same about Professor Sombart?&#8221;
The review tears the book to tatters, and the reviewer
sums up the opinion of the thoughtful by declaring that
the publication of such a piece of writing at this time
of crisis is altogether scandalous. The course of
journalists during this war has so often been down
steep places that we are refreshed whenever we come,
either in England or in Germany, upon so brave a stand
for a sane view of the enemy. Karl Bleibtreu (as
quoted in the <i>Daily News</i>, July 8, 1915) writes in the
<i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>, &#8220;Such foolish effusions as that of
Professor Sombart&#8217;s &#8216;Traders and Heroes,&#8217; revealing
no conception of the more profound movements of the
soul, must be regarded as an error. The true perception
is here blurred by a confusion of the British
private character, which is worthy in every way of
the highest respect, with the State policy which is
dominated by a national megalomania.&#8221; We are told
that Bleibtreu abuses France. Well, we have known
rather distinguished Englishmen abuse France, too.
The <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> has spoken of &#8220;the really
heroic bravery&#8221; of the Black Watch. The <i>K&ouml;lnische
Zeitung</i> reproduced a spirited article from the Austrian
<i>Danzers Armee Zeitung</i> in which that paper said the
generous thing about Serbian, Belgian and Russian
armies alike. This article also was a protest against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>the lower tone which has prevailed by no means only
amongst the newspapers printed in German. The
Serbians are spoken of as &#8220;an enemy who can hardly
be surpassed in keenness and untiring energy.&#8221; No
one has any right, the article says, to abuse the Belgians
who had a right to fight and who fought very well, notwithstanding
the notoriously unmilitary character of
their country. Of the Russians we are told, &#8220;We
must admit that these armies are well led, excellently
equipped, and splendidly armed.... There have
been individual cases of disregard of the Red Cross, and
one hears of occasional plunderings, but, as regards the
majority, it is an honourable and chivalrous enemy
that is facing us.&#8221; The love of fair play is after all
not confined to Englishmen, or to the opponents of
Germany.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i> of March 26, 1918, quotes from the
<i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>, which writes of the British enemy
as &#8220;defending himself with extraordinary determination
and bravery.... Our men speak in terms of the
highest praise of the attitude of the enemy. The
Englishman is an extremely brave soldier.&#8221; I confess
I should be glad to read tributes of like generosity in
certain popular newspapers on this side. The <i>Deutsche
Tageszeitung</i> is also quoted as saying that the British
defended every one of their points of support
determinedly and bravely, giving way only step by
step. Again, von Ludendorff (March 27) is quoted as
saying: &#8220;The English use and distribute their
machine guns very cleverly,&#8221; and there is something
out of keeping with the attributed Ludendorff character
in the remark: &#8220;The district over which the offensive
has passed is pitiable.&#8221;</p>

<p>On April 4, 1918, the <i>Daily News</i> contained the
following under the heading, &#8220;A Respectful Greeting
sent per balloon by the Germans&#8221;:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>In a dispatch from the front Reuter&#8217;s special correspondent
says there is a certain sporting element in the German army,
and relates the following incident:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>During the thick of the first clash a small balloon came
floating down to where our men were making a splendid
resistance. On being captured it was found to be carrying
the following message: &#8220;Good old 51st! Sticking it still!
Good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>The 51st, which is one of the three first divisions to be
named in official communiqu&eacute;s for magnificently opposing
the enemy hordes, is known to be regarded by the Germans
as one of our most formidable corps.</p></div>

<p>On April 15 we read of Armenti&egrave;res: &#8220;A Berlin
semi-official statement says that despite the ever-increasing
pressure of the enveloping troops the town
held out extraordinarily bravely. Only when, by a
flank onslaught of the German troops, envelopment to
the west of the town was almost completed, did the
remnant of the brave garrison surrender.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here is a letter from an Englishwoman in
Germany (<i>Nation</i>, May 15, 1915): &#8220;&#8216;Gott strafe
England&#8217; is a &#8216;Spruch&#8217; in great use here, and is to be
had on rubber stamps.... School children are
taught it.... This is a fact, but all the better-thinking
people deplore it, and I wonder whether, if it
is ever recorded in history, it will also be recorded that
the Kaiser has now strictly forbidden it. It will die,
but gradually. It is the idea of some silly loud-mouthed
ass, and the people, like sheep, followed it.&#8221;
Professor Wrangel, a German authority on pedagogy,
urges the avoidance of instilling hatred into the young,
and he tells us that the Bavarian Government has
instructed its teachers to avoid in their lessons all
language insulting to the enemy. (<i>Daily Chronicle</i>,
June 19, 1915.) In July, 1915, the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>
published a long article on the situation in England,
written by a neutral observer. The London <i>Daily
News</i> describes it as giving &#8220;on the whole a fair and
conscientious presentation of facts.&#8221; The article points
out that the average Englishman regards the war as a
war of defence (just as the average German does).
The article warmly praises England for the way in
which it won the loyalty of the Boer Republics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>In the <i>Montag</i> (the Monday edition of the Berlin
<i>Lokalanzeiger</i>) Herr E. Zimmermann stoutly defended
actions of both neutrals and enemies that the more
biased in Germany had condemned. &#8220;Reproach
levelled against America for supplying war material to
our enemies is unjust. Germany herself, at the Hague
Conference, caused the rejection of the proposal to
prohibit the supply of war material to belligerents by
neutral countries. Only the prohibition of supply of
war material by the Governments of neutral States
exists, while private industry is free to act as it likes.
So far America, as a State, has supplied no war
material.&#8221; In his attitude towards America, says
Herr Zimmermann, the Imperial Chancellor &#8220;need
take no notice of those ferocious heroes who take care
to keep themselves at a distance from the hail of
bullets in safe retreat....&#8221; We know something of
those ferocious heroes on this side too.</p>

<p>Again, &#8220;I cannot share in the political sentimentality
which represents England&#8217;s attempt to starve us into
submission as an exceedingly mean thing. I cannot
share in it because it would have been a pleasure to
me if I could apply with success the same war tactics
to England. We must not forget that it is not really
a question of actually starving to death tens of millions
of men and women, but only of constraining them to
lay down their arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Edwin Pears writes in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of
October 10, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> has been allowed to publish a
statement which not unfairly represents the situation. It
says that the Greek crisis raises the question: &#8220;Who is the
stronger? The King with the General Staff and the great
part of the Army, or Venizelos and the Cabinet who embody
the will of the country as represented in the Chamber?&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This is a singularly fair and frank statement of the
facts of the crisis, as they at first presented themselves.
The <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> is no doubt distinguished for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>the reasonableness of its outlook, but I think that anyone
reading the better German newspapers must (in
the days when they were available) have felt a little
prick of wounded pride when he compared them with
our own. The <i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i> is, for instance, like
all belligerent newspapers, ridiculously biased; but in
the earlier days, when I was able to see it, I did not
find gross misrepresentation or absurd hate. The &#8220;not
very tasteful &#8216;Gott strafe England&#8217;&#8221; has given the
English a new word, one writer remarks (Sept. 21,
1915). Naturally, American testimony favourable to
Germany is exclusively quoted, just as in this country
we quoted exclusively that favourable to the Entente.
And some space was given to the utterances of such
men as Sven Hedin and Bj&ouml;rn Bj&ouml;rnson, who, as
neutral observers, had formed a high opinion of the
way that German character was meeting the crisis.
There was not, however, so much of the curious
sanctimonious malice which has disfigured some of the
well-known English papers.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">School-Books.</span></h3>

<p>If children are to be told of the war at all, the central
duty of any teacher should surely be to avoid stimulating
those feelings of hatred which might obscure the
chances of future peace. On the whole, the German
school-books I have before me seem to fulfil this duty,
or at least to aim at fulfilling it.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> There are, of course,
many stories of the achievements and the courage of
the German soldiers. All peoples have dwelt on
physical courage in too primitive a way. But these
books scarcely encourage hate. A letter from France
tells how German soldiers tried to help the starving
people. The writer is very obviously sincere. &#8220;In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>one village near our fortifications the people were
crying with hunger. It was woeful. I gave them all
the bread I had. The children were always asking for
more, and kissed our hands. That moved us all
greatly. Naturally we told the Commandant.&#8221; As a
result, twelve women were allowed to pass through the
lines blindfolded to fetch food from &mdash;&mdash;. This story
is not one to encourage hate, and again and again there
are stories of German sympathy with the enemy.</p>

<p>A sad account of incidents of the Russian invasion
begins: &#8220;Of course, not all Russians are barbarians,
most of the misdeeds are due to the Cossacks.&#8221; (I
could not help on reading this calling to mind some of
the wilder anti-German outbursts. An official in a
rather responsible position said to me that he could not
see &#8220;a single redeeming feature in any one of them.&#8221;
It was a childish outburst, but childishness in a
position of authority becomes cruelty.) A story one
German school-book tells of a wounded Belgian sounds
only the note of pity, and there is a wonderful little
picture of a wounded German&#8217;s suspicion of a wounded
Russian. The story is finely told, but I cannot
reproduce it all here. The Russian is in pain and
thirst, the wounded German hesitates between
suspicion and pity, but pity gets the upper hand, and
he crawls with his water bottle to the Russian. Later,
as he lies helpless, his fears are aroused by seeing the
Russian fumble with something in his breast. Is it a
revolver? The wounded German, overstrained with
suffering, waits in terror, but the Russian dies before
his hand can bring out what it sought. When the
stretcher bearers come the German asks the leader to
look for the revolver which he feared the Russian was
trying to get out. The leader goes to look. He brings
back what the Russian&#8217;s dying hand was seeking. No revolver,
but the portrait of his mother. This rebuke
of hatred and suspicion would live in a child&#8217;s mind for
long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>The effects of the anti-German outbursts can be
traced even in these books. When an officer finds the
Sisters of a nunnery in want, his ready help is
accompanied by the words: &#8220;This little kindness is
the act of German barbarians, who refuse all thanks.
As long as we are here, each barbarian soldier will give
up a little, so that you may have their savings every
three days, and then you will have plenty.... Enjoy
it, and be as happy as you can.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Belgium and War Aims.</span></h3>

<p>Professor Martin-Rade of Marburg University is a
Protestant Liberal Theologian and a man well known
in his own country on account of his literary and
political activities. He writes as follows in the
<i>Christliche Welt</i>, a widely-circulated magazine of
which he is the editor: &#8220;I can only deplore the manner
in which the Chancellor in his speech ... has
treated the question of neutral countries, for there was
no need for him to have recourse to the proverb,
&#8216;Necessity knows no law.&#8217; With that proverb I cannot
convince these who behold in the existence of neutral
States a triumph of the rights of man. That is why it
is a pity&mdash;for which it is hard indeed to make reparation&mdash;that
the German Empire should not have abstained
altogether, at the very outset, from the sin ...
which it has committed against Belgium. Whoever
accuses my view of being unpatriotic I challenge, by
whatever test he likes, to show that he loves his Fatherland
better than I do.&#8221; (From a letter in the <i>Nation</i>,
November 28, 1914.)</p>

<p>Again, as early as December, 1914, at a meeting of
the Socialist Party in the Reichstag a resolution was
proposed in favour of (<i>a</i>) the evacuation of Belgium,
and (<i>b</i>) the setting up of plebiscites in Schleswig and
Alsace-Lorraine to determine the future government
of those districts. It was defeated, but twenty four
members voted for it. (<i>Nation</i>, January 23, 1915.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>To estimate the full value of this we must try to
envisage the state of mind of a nation at war. This
is notoriously difficult. We cannot picture our <i>own</i>
state of mind, because it is obviously impossible at one
and the same time to be intensely moved and to picture
this emotion without emotional bias. And our bias
renders us perhaps equally incapable of envisaging the
mind of the enemy. It will be necessary therefore
somewhat wilfully to exaggerate an analogy in order
to see how Germans may feel. Let us conceive,
then, twenty-four members of the House of Commons
proposing (in the midst of the war) (<i>a</i>) the raising of all
blockade restrictions against neutrals, the evacuation
of all neutral territories (whether Grecian or Persian),
and (<i>b</i>) the setting up of plebiscites in Ireland, India
and Egypt, to determine the future governments of
those districts. I can imagine somewhat heated or
contemptuous treatment of this comparison. Just so:
the Germans are heated too, and they no longer see
clearly. And we must never forget that they have
had long training in obedience to government. There
are not wanting English politicians who would like to
see similar training introduced here. It leads however
to the hypnotic response of which Colonel Maude
has written interestingly in his &#8220;War and the World&#8217;s
Life.&#8221; The Government in Germany called for the
defence of the Fatherland, the Government declared
the invasion of Belgium as unavoidable. The hypnotic
response followed, but at least twenty-four members of
the national legislature woke from the trance and
<i>thought</i>. I have attempted in my comparison only to
suggest how much independence, how much cutting of
bonds and attachments that thought required. I press
the analogy no further. What is noticeable is that
this thought, voiced so early and unmistakably, has
been gaining wider and wider utterance. It appears
that in December, 1914, Herr Haase, speaking in the
Reichstag for the Social Democrats, declared that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>party were unanimously of opinion that the facts which
had come to light since the beginning of the war were
not sufficient evidence for them to adopt the Imperial
Chancellor&#8217;s view that the violation of the neutrality
of Luxemburg and Belgium was justified by military
reasons. The party had come to the conclusion and
had agreed that the violation of Luxemburg and
Belgium must be regarded as a violation of justice.
The above declaration seems to have been suppressed
in the German papers. It reached the <i>Labour Leader</i>
from Holland.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Against Annexation.</span></h3>

<p>We have all of us read the celebrated manifesto
issued by the National Executive of the German Social
Democratic Party which the <i>Vorw&auml;rts</i> was suppressed
for publishing. Let us remind ourselves of a few
passages in that document. It was issued in June,
1915. &#8220;When in recent years the threatening clouds
of war gathered on the political horizon, the German
Socialists stood with all their strength up to the last
hour, for the preservation of peace. To the misfortune
of the peoples, the Socialists in all countries were not
yet strong enough to hold back the terrible fate which
has come upon Europe. The torch of war flared up
sharply and set the whole world on fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Cossacks of the Tsar passed over the
frontiers, plundering and burning, the German
Socialists proved true to the word which their leaders
had given to the German people. They put themselves
at the service of their country and voted the
means for its defence....</p>

<p>&#8220;The Parliamentary Party and the Party Executive
have always unanimously opposed the policy of
conquests and of annexations. We raise once more
the sharpest protests against all attempts to secure the
annexation of foreign territories and the violation of
the rights of other peoples, particularly as they have
been expressed in the demands of great Capitalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Federations and in the speeches of leading capitalist
politicians. To make such attempts delays more than
ever the peace which is strongly desired by the whole
people. <i>The people do not want any annexations.
The people want peace.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Executive of the Social
Democratic Party of Germany</span>. June 23, 1915,
Berlin.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we remember that the Social Democrats of
Germany number about four millions,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the importance
of this manifesto becomes clearer. It is a tremendous
fact. The loud-voiced threats of crushing, boycott,
etc., by influential sections on this side have been one
of the greatest hindrances to the Social Democrats, and
one of the greatest aids to German militarists.</p>

<p>We heard much in 1915 of the &#8220;annexation split&#8221;
in Germany. The Delbr&uuml;ck-Dernburg-Wolff Memorial
represented, to my thinking, nothing strange, or new,
or abnormal, but rather the voice of natural and normal
Germany making itself heard again amidst the clamour
of foolish hatred and silly bombast in which present-day
crises seem always to involve the contending
nations. &#8220;Germany did not enter the war with the
idea of annexation&#8221;&mdash;thus the Memorial opens. It is
easy to scoff at this statement, because it is always
easier in a crisis to be swayed entirely by bias.
Frankly, as regards <i>Germany</i>, that is (if this word is
to have any meaning), as regards the mass of the
German people, I believe this statement to be true.
Whatever the militarist and commercial schemers may
have contrived, Germany as a whole did not enter the
war with the idea of annexation, but, as the Memorial
goes on, &#8220;in order to preserve its existence, threatened
by the enemy coalition against its national unity and
its progressive development. In concluding peace,
Germany cannot pursue anything that does not serve
these objects.&#8221; Who were the signatories to this
Memorial? Amongst the 82 names are those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Professor Hans Delbr&uuml;ck, Dr. Dernburg (the ex-Minister),
Professor Adolf von Harnack (the theologian
and General Director of the Royal Library at Berlin),
Theodore Wolff (Editor of the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>), Dr.
Oppenheim (who holds an important position in the
dye industries), Carl Permet (Judge of the Berlin Commercial
Courts), Prince von Hatzfeld, Franz von
Mendelsohn (President of the Berlin Chamber of
Commerce), Prince Donnersmarck, Count von Leyden
(ex-ambassador), Dr. August Stein (Editor of the
<i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>), Major von Parseval (the designer
of the famous airship). These are representative
names. They stand, I think, with the Social
Democrats for the real Germany.</p>

<p>The <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> has returned again and again
to the charge. Here, for instance, is an extract from
an article by Herr Theodore Wolff as given in the <i>Daily
News</i> of February 4, 1916:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Since August 4, 1914, the Belgian question has been
withdrawn from public discussion, and only the advocates of
a boundless policy of grab are now and again impelled by
their temperament to throw off all restraint. Because these
voices are alone audible, the Paris papers and those Belgian
papers which are published in London are able constantly to
din into the ears of the war-weary Belgians and the world at
large that Belgium has only the choice between the continuation
of the war and complete destruction. In this way, by
asserting that in Germany at most only a few Socialists and
pacifists without influence are opposed to the policy of
annexation, they succeed in stifling again and again any
aspiration towards peace. It is therefore necessary and
useful at least to proclaim from time to time that this assertion,
as will be demonstrated on the very first day when free
discussion is allowed, is absolutely incorrect.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Germany and Contracts.</span></h3>

<p>The real German is not simply a brute, though the
brute lies perdu in every civilised man. Mr. Herbert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>Hoover, formerly Chairman of the Commission of
Relief in Belgium, said, &#8220;The German authorities
place no obstruction in the way of relief, and, as far as
can be ascertained, not one loaf of bread or one spoonful
of salt supplied by the Relief Commission has been
taken by the Germans.&#8221; (<i>Times</i>, c. December 6,
1914).</p>

<p>It has often been said in this country that according
to German rules contracts with enemy subjects are cancelled
by the mere fact of war. The <i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>
published a legal opinion disposing of this statement.
No law to this effect exists, and none has been enacted.
&#8220;Only the right of enemies to secure enforcement of
contracts by means of legal process has been curtailed.
Moreover, the making of payments to England, France
or Russia has been prohibited. But these last-named
prohibitions presuppose the legal validity of the contracts
themselves, since they declare the payments due
under them to be merely postponed.&#8221; (<i>Daily News</i>,
August 20, 1915.)</p>

<p>An old friend of mine was in process of negotiating
patent rights in Germany for an invention of his at the
time that war broke out. He was allowed to complete
the claim to the patent, and it was granted him after
Germany and Britain were at war.</p>


<h3>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Frightfulness.</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p>Not every one in Germany is obsessed with a conviction
of the efficacy of &#8220;frightfulness.&#8221; This is plain
from the fact that the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> published
articles from its neutral correspondent in England
which point out that each phase of frightfulness had
precisely the opposite effect of that which was intended.
The bombardments of coast towns, the use of
asphyxiating gases, the sinking of the Lusitania all led,
he remarks, to increased recruiting and intensified war
feeling. Each act of frightfulness has of course been
represented to the German public in a very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>light from that in which it has been presented to us,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and it is therefore the more striking that so influential
a newspaper should publish such an opinion. When
the Lusitania was sunk, both the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>
and the <i>Vorw&auml;rts</i> maintained an absolute silence, and
these are the two most influential organs in Berlin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Brotherhood of Enemies.</span></h3>

<p>The soldier&#8217;s attitude is often that of Captain Ball,
the boy who did such wonders in the air fight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I attacked two Albatross scouts and crashed them, killing
the pilots. In the end I was brought down, but am quite
O.K. Oh, it was a good fight, and the Huns were fine
sports. One tried to ram me after he was hit, and only
missed by inches. Am indeed looked after by God, but oh!
I do get tired of always living to kill and am really beginning
to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have
finished.</p></div>

<p>Quoted in the <i>Daily News</i>, May 7, 1918. Captain
Ball has finished the killing in the only way boys can
finish the killing now, for he is dead. The last words,
<i>Requiescat in pace</i>, have a new poignancy in days when
children are growing up who have never known peace.</p>

<p>Yet underneath all the wild recriminations prompted
by fear and hate, there is brotherhood. For at the
worst what do all these charges mean? That a few
foolish men without vision have slipped into power and
direct the great beast-machine that kills. That
Frankenstein is apt at all times to wild, primitive
cruelty. What may it be when foolish, hard theorists
are its masters? Yet, for all that, the people out of
whom Frankensteins are made are of one flesh, are
all brothers, all parts of the great Life which some
call God. Now and then, amidst their fiercest fighting,
this becomes plain. It sometimes seems as if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>main concern of rulers were to prevent any permanent
realisation of this truth; for if the peoples should
realise their oneness, war would cease, and there is
nothing that stops awkward questions as war does.
Yet some day these awkward questions will be asked
again, I hope, and Hans and Jack and Fran&ccedil;ois and
Ivan may come to realise their brotherhood. Let us
remind ourselves how now and then they can realise
this even in war. &#8220;Who will not recall in this connection,&#8221;
writes Prince Eug&eacute;ne Troubetzky in the
<i>Hibbert</i> (July, 1915), &#8220;the touching description of the
Christmas festival in the trenches, when the Germans,
hearing the English singing their hymns, went out to
meet them and heartily shook their enemies by the
hand? Similar scenes have occurred more than once
between the Russians and the Germans. At the
present moment there lies before me the letter of a
Russian soldier which refers to them: &#8216;What I am
going to tell you,&#8217; he says, &#8216;is a true miracle.&#8217; The
&#8216;miracle&#8217; which had so appealed to his imagination
was that, during an armistice, there were &#8216;handshakes
and hearty acclamations on both sides, to which no
description could do justice.&#8217; ... From the very
heart of war there issues this mighty protest of life
against the destructive force of death. But whenever
life asserts itself, its object is always to re-establish a
living unity. The more violently unity is threatened
by war, or by the mutual hate which would tear it
asunder, the more powerful becomes the answer of this
spiritual force in its effort to re-establish the integrity
of mankind. In this we have the explanation of a fact,
which at first sight seems incredible, that in time of
war the perception of the universal solidarity of mankind
reaches a degree of elevation which would hardly
be possible in time of peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Christmas Eve,&#8221; writes a member of the
London Rifle Brigade, &#8220;the Germans burned coloured
lights and candles along the top of their trenches, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>on Christmas Day a football match was played between
them and us in front of the trench. They even allowed
us to bury all our dead lying in front, and some of
them, with hats in hand, brought in some of our dead
officers from behind their trench, so that we could bury
them decently. They were really magnificent in the
whole thing, and jolly good sorts. I have now a very
different opinion of the German. Both sides have
started the firing, and are already enemies again.
Strange it all seems, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; (<i>Nation</i>, January
2, 1915.)</p>

<p>&#8220;These Germans were enduring the same hardships,
and the same squalor. There was only pity for them
and a sense of comradeship, as of men forced by the
cruel gods to be tortured by fate. This sense of comradeship
reached strange lengths at Christmas, and on
other days. Truces were established and men who had
been engaged in trying to kill each other came out of
opposite trenches and fraternised. They took photographs
of mixed groups of Germans and English, arm-in-arm.
They exchanged cigarettes, and patted each
other on the shoulder, and cursed the war.... The
war had become the most tragic farce in the world.
The frightful senselessness of it was apparent when
the enemies of two nations fighting to the death stood
in the grey mist together and liked each other. They
did not want to kill each other, these Saxons of the
same race and blood, so like each other in physical
appearance, and with the same human qualities....
The monstrous absurdity of war, this devil&#8217;s jest, stood
revealed nakedly by those little groups of men standing
together in the mists of Flanders.... It became
so apparent that army orders had to be issued stopping
such truces.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is only by artificial stimulus, by artificially made
ignorance, that war can be kept going in these days.
By which I do not mean to imply that commanders
and leaders are wilfully cruel men; but the leaders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>on each side are afraid lest <i>their</i> men should give up
fighting first. To be the first to acknowledge brotherhood
seems like being the first to give in, and actually
does foreshadow serious dangers. And yet the time
will come when we shall have to face danger for the
sake of brotherhood, as we do now for the sake of self-assertion.
The orders to avoid friendship with the
enemy were, even in these circumstances, not always
obeyed. &#8220;For months after German and British
soldiers in neighbouring trenches fixed up secret
treaties by which they fired at fixed targets at stated
periods to keep up appearances and then strolled about
in safety, sure of each other&#8217;s loyalty.&#8221; (Gibbs, &#8220;The
Soul of the War,&#8221; p.&nbsp;351.) Prisoners were sent back
to their own trenches, and sometimes went with great
reluctance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wounded.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;He told me how on the night he had his own wound
French and German soldiers talked together by light
of the moon, which shed its pale light upon all those
prostrate men, making their faces look very white. He
heard the murmurs of their voices about him, and
the groans of the dying, rising to hideous anguish as
men were tortured by ghastly wounds and broken
limbs. In that night enmity was forgotten by those
who had fought like beasts and now lay together. A
French soldier gave his water-bottle to a German
officer who was crying out with thirst. The German
sipped a little and then kissed the hand of the man
who had been his enemy. &#8216;There will be no war on
the other side,&#8217; he said. Another Frenchman&mdash;who
came from Montmartre&mdash;found lying within a yard of
him a Luxembourgeois whom he had known as his
<i>chasseur</i> in a big hotel in Paris. The young German
wept to see his old acquaintance. &#8216;It is stupid,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;this war. You and I were happy when we were
good friends in Paris. Why should we have been made
to fight with each other?&#8217; He died with his arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>round the neck of the soldier, who told me the story
unashamed of his own tears.&#8221; (Gibbs, l.c. p.&nbsp;282) &#8220;At
one spot where there had been a fierce hand-to-hand
fight, there were indications that the combatants when
wounded had shared their water bottles.&#8221; (<i>Sheffield
Telegraph</i>, November 14, 1914.)</p>

<p>The following letter must not be forgotten. It was
found at the side of a dead French cavalry officer:
&#8220;There are two other men lying near me, and I do not
think there is much hope for them either. One is an
officer of a Scottish regiment, and the other is a private
in the Uhlans. They were struck down after me, and
when I came to myself, I found them bending over
me, rendering first aid. The Britisher was pouring
water down my throat from his flask, while the German
was endeavouring to staunch my wound with an anti-septic
preparation served out to them by their medical
corps. The Highlander had one of his legs shattered,
and the German had several pieces of shrapnel buried
in his side. In spite of their own suffering they were
trying to help me, and when I was fully conscious
again, the German gave us a morphia injection and
took one himself. His medical corps had also provided
him with the injection and the needle, together
with printed instructions for its use. After the
injection, feeling wonderfully at ease, we spoke of the
lives we had lived before the war. We all spoke
English, and we talked of the women we had left at
home. Both the German and the Britisher had only
been married a year. I wondered, and I suppose the
others did, why we had fought each other at all....&#8221;
(<i>Daily Citizen</i>, December 21, 1914. Quoted in Edward
Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;The Healing of Nations,&#8221; p.&nbsp;261.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">More Christmas Incidents.</span></h3>

<p>Let us take one or two more of the Christmas
experiences as quoted by Mr. Edward Carpenter, in
his book, &#8220;The Healing of Nations&#8221;: &#8220;Last night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>(Christmas Eve) was the weirdest stunt I have ever
seen. All day the Germans had been sniping industriously,
with some success, but after sunset they
started singing, and we replied with carols. Then they
shouted, &#8216;Happy Christmas!&#8217; to us, and some of us
replied in German. It was a topping moonlight night,
and we carried on long conversations, and kept singing
to each other and cheering. Later they asked us to
send one man out to the middle, between the trenches,
with a cake, and they would give us a bottle of wine.
Hunt went out, and five of them came out and gave
him the wine, cigarettes and cigars. After that you
could hear them for a long time calling from half-way,
&#8216;Englishman, kom hier.&#8217; So one or two more of our
chaps went out and exchanged cigarettes, etc., and
they all seemed decent fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again. &#8220;We had quite a sing-song last night (Christmas
Eve). The Germans gave a song, and then our
chaps gave them one in return. A German that could
speak English, and some others, came right up to our
trenches, and we gave them cigarettes and papers to
read, as they never get any news, and then we let them
walk back to their own trenches. Then our chaps
went over to their trenches, and they let them come
back all right. About five o&#8217;clock on Christmas Eve
one of them shouted across and told us that if we did
not fire on them they would not open fire on us, and
so the officers agreed. About twenty of them came up
all at once and started chatting away to our chaps like
old chums, and neither side attempted to shoot.&#8221;
Another soldier relates how his comrades and the
Saxons opposed to them sang and shouted to each other
through the night. He goes on, &#8220;When daylight
came, two of our fellows, at the invitation of the
enemy, left the trenches, met half-way and drank
together. That completed it. They said they would
not fire, if we did not; so after that we strolled about
talking to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>On Christmas morning, elsewhere. &#8220;We mixed
together, played mouth-organs and took part in dances.
My word! The Germans can&#8217;t half sing part songs!
We exchanged addresses and souvenirs, and when the
time came we shook hands and saluted each other,
returning to our trenches. I went up into the trenches
on Christmas night. One wouldn&#8217;t have thought
there was a war going on. All day our soldiers and
the Germans were talking and singing half-way
between the opposing trenches. The space was filled
with English and Germans handing one another cigars.
At night we sang carols.&#8221; Another records how
souvenirs and food were exchanged, and how jollification
and football were indulged in with the Germans.
But &#8220;next day we got an order that all communication
and friendly intercourse must cease.&#8221; The Germans
had said frankly they were tired of the war, the English
soldiers wished to be their friends, but far away were
a few elderly men who wanted the fighting to go on.</p>

<p>Into what depths the need of exacerbating hate may
lead one is shown by the following extract from a telegram
headed, &#8220;British Headquarters, France,&#8221; which
I take from the <i>Daily News</i> of December 23, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>No doubt the Bosches will have plenty of Christmas trees,
as they did last year, but, without attaching too much
credence to the reports of an increasing difficulty in maintaining
their rations. I think it is quite safe to say that they
will fare very much more frugally than our own men. But
may not their own consciousness of the fact result in an outburst
of &#8220;strafing?&#8221; The principle that the next best thing
to not getting well served yourself is to spoil the other fellow&#8217;s
enjoyment is a good sound Hunnish axiom. There will
certainly be no amenities nor anything in the nature of a
truce so far as the British are concerned. All ranks are
bidden to remember that war is war and that the Germans
invariably have some sinister motive in all they do, especially
under the guise of a gush of friendly sentiment.&mdash;Reuter.</p></div>

<p>The last sentences must surely, in any generous
heart (if the moral destruction of war has left us such),
produce a feeling of acute shame. In all the multitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>of truces that occurred at Christmas, 1914, I have not
seen a single case of German treachery reported.
What is it that is feared in the truce? &#8220;In some
places,&#8221; said a German officer, &#8220;we have had to
change our men several times. They get too damn
friendly.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> &#8220;If we don&#8217;t take care,&#8221; said an English
officer that Christmas, &#8220;there will be a permanent
peace without generals or c.o.&#8217;s having a say in the
matter.&#8221; Is that thought really more terrible than the
thought of unnumbered shattered bodies and hopeless
hearts?</p>

<p>How ineffectual so far are all European attempts at
democracy! Carlyle&#8217;s satire about the thirty men
of Dumdrudge called out, they know not why, to kill
thirty men from a Dumdrudge elsewhere is not
referred to in these days; but it still expresses the
essential absurdity of wars.</p>

<p>Here is an extract from the <i>Labour Leader</i> of
August 19, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>My friend must not be identified. But here is an incident
he told me I can safely relate. During the unauthorised
Christmas truce of eight months ago so chummy did a British
officer and a Saxon officer become that the Saxon officer
gave his enemy &#8220;an invitation to visit him in Germany at
the end of the war,&#8221; and &#8220;stay as long as you like,&#8221; he
added. The British officer is still carrying the address in
his pocket in the hope that one day he may be able to
accept the invitation.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Labour Leader</i> is much disliked by the
orthodox of England, as is the <i>Vorw&auml;rts</i> by the orthodox
of Germany. It seems to me that both may be rendering
a fine service to the cause of humanity, and one
may surely say this without implying complete agreement
with the opinions or the policy of either.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wounded Enemies.</span></h3>

<p>Writing home to his mother in Somerset, a member
of the R.A.M.C. says: &#8220;You will find inside a German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>button for a souvenir. It was given me by a wounded
German prisoner. After he had had his wound
dressed, he pointed to his buttons and made signs for
me to cut one off. He hardly knew how to thank us
after he had finished his tea, and his eyes gleamed with
gratitude as he looked around at us.&#8221; (<i>Daily News</i>,
August 26, 1915.)</p>

<p>From a private letter: &#8220;The following is first hand,
and of interest. Dr. S. lectures on first aid to C.&#8217;s
squad. During the course of a lecture on the heart he
referred to a visit paid to the local hospital. In the
hospital was a man who had been a prisoner in
Germany. Dr. S. asked the man about his treatment.
In the course of the talk the man said that if he had
his choice he would prefer to be in a German hospital!
Dr. S. smiled when he related this. &#8216;This is not the
kind of statement,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that is published in the
newspapers!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There comes into my mind the photograph of a
British prisoner in a German camp. The boy&#8217;s mother
was delighted to see him looking so well. The photograph
was the more striking as the lad was wounded in
the stomach at the time he was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>From a private letter: &#8220;My nephew was in the
Canadians and was wounded in the spine in a recent
advance.... He was brought back to London,
where I saw him, and he died in hospital shortly after.
He told me himself all about it. He lay for several
hours after being wounded, unable of course to move.
When the ambulance came up, the stretcher bearers
were Germans&mdash;prisoners of war. They saw he was
cold and took off their own coats and wrapped him up.
All the while they were under fire from the British
guns.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> One of them was wounded in the arm by
shrapnel as they were carrying him, but he kept his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>hold. He called to his mate to let down the stretcher,
but till it was on the ground, he never flinched. My
nephew knew what this meant, and as he thought of
what had been done for him by an &#8216;enemy&#8217; his face
lighted up, as he said, &#8216;That man is a hero!&#8217; And he
added, &#8216;We don&#8217;t feel hard towards them at the
front.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, a wounded soldier who had been prisoner in
Germany says: &#8220;I could not have been better treated,
and I know ninety companions who say the same. But
this is not the sort of story the newspapers want.&#8221;
People very generally do not like to hear good of an
enemy. In war-time this very human objection may
become an important cause of continued strife. (cf.,
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_108">108</a>.)</p>

<p>In the following, Philip Gibbs tells of a German
doctor who tended friend and foe alike. &#8220;A number
of Germans ... &mdash;about 250 of them&mdash;stayed in the
dug-outs, without food and water, while our shells
made a fury above them and smashed up the ground.
They had a German doctor there, a giant of a man
with a great heart, who had put his first-aid dressing
station in the second line trench, and attended to the
wounds of the men until our bombardment intensified
so that no man could live there.</p>

<p>&#8220;He took the wounded down to a dug-out&mdash;those
who had not been carried back&mdash;and stayed there
expecting death. But then, as he told me to-day, at
about eleven o&#8217;clock this morning the shells ceased to
scream and roar above-ground, and after a sudden
silence he heard the noise of British troops. He went
up to the entrance of his dug-out and said to some
English soldiers who came up with fixed bayonets,
&#8216;My friends, I surrender.&#8217; Afterwards he helped to
tend our own wounded, and did very good work for us
under the fire of his own guns, which had now turned
upon this position.&#8221; (<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, July 5, 1916.)</p>

<p>It must be easy to tell bad stories of every furious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>fight, but the right spirit is surely that shown by Mr.
Gibbs in another despatch (<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, July 7,
1916): &#8220;The enemy behaved well, I am told, to our
wounded men at some parts of the line, and helped
them over the parapets. This makes us loth to tell
other stories not so good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, on July 21, 1916: &#8220;It was the turn of the
stretcher-bearers, and they worked with great courage.
And here one must pay a tribute to the enemy. &#8216;We
had white men against us,&#8217; said one of the officers,
&#8216;and they let us get in our wounded without hindrance
as soon as the fight was over.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This war!&#8217; said a German doctor, &#8216;We go on
killing each other to no purpose.&#8217;&#8221; (<i>Daily Chronicle</i>,
July 5, 1916.)</p>

<p>And on this side:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The wife of a petty officer described to me the arrival of
the first batch of wounded. It happened that these were
chiefly Germans. &#8220;I thought I wouldn&#8217;t care so long as I
didn&#8217;t see our poor boys carried up,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but when
I saw them, Germans or not, I couldn&#8217;t help crying.&#8221; I
gathered that the sight of the sufferers swept away every
feeling but sympathy amongst the onlookers. She told me
of the funerals to the little churchyard outside the barracks,
and of the &#8220;loneliness&#8221; of the dead Germans. She had
wept by those nameless graves, thinking of those that
belonged to these strangers.&mdash;Louie Bennett in the <i>Labour
Leader</i>.</p></div>

<p>I remember a Cockney boy of fifteen telling me how
at Southend he had gone for fun to see wounded
Germans brought ashore. But the fun died out in his
heart at the reality, and he ran away.</p>

<p>The little incident I will next mention has special
charm because of the beautiful spirit shown by every
one concerned. A wounded German, Albert Dill, lay
in hospital here. He was asked by a visitor if there
was anything that he specially wished for. He
answered. &#8220;Flowers for the dear English nurse, more
than anything else.&#8221; The flowers were sent and his
letter of gratitude is touching. There were far more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>than he expected, he said, and his joy was the greater.
&#8220;The pleasure of the nurses and the doctors too was
great when they saw this rich gift of flowers (diese
reiche Blumenspende).... This day will often
remind me of the good and self-sacrificing nursing that
I have had here in this hospital.&#8221; And the &#8220;dear
English nurse&#8221; writes: &#8220;The flowers you sent at the
request of Albert Dill were indeed most beautiful....
I have been nursing the German patients for a considerable
time, and their gratitude has always been
most marked. We sincerely hope that while carrying
out our duties we have been able to relieve their
sufferings, and have perhaps helped them to bear the
misfortunes of war a little more patiently.&#8221; This little
incident is surely the greatest of victories, for it is a
victory of the spirit.</p>

<p>Nurse Kathleen Cambridge, who was near Mons at
the time of the British retreat, spoke as follows of some
of her experiences (<i>Daily News</i>, January 8, 1916):</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>After the battle I was very pleased to be of assistance to
the wounded, for whom my mother and I had arranged an
ambulance. It was at four o&#8217;clock that I saw the first party
of British prisoners being marched through from Mons to
Brussels. A halt was called just outside the Chateau. The
Germans were very kind at that time and offered their
prisoners cigarettes and gave them water from their bottles.</p>

<p>Two men, exhausted by terrible wounds, dropped into the
ditch. The baron went off to ask if we could be of assistance,
and the German doctor told him that he would be
grateful for any help, as he had to get on to Brussels and
could not wait. The two men were brought into the chateau.
We did all we could for them, and gradually, after some
weeks, they recovered.</p></div>

<p>Neglect and honourable conduct are both recorded in
the next cutting from the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>
(September 17, 1917).</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A Scotsman wounded at La Bass&eacute;e had lain for eight days
in a German dug-out which our troops had captured and
from which they had been driven. One party of Germans
peering into the darkness had bombed him, and added one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>or two slight wounds to the twenty-two he already possessed.
He managed to signal to the second bombing party some
days later, and was carried away to the field hospital, where
hundreds of wounded Germans were lying. Here he was
found by a young German engineer who had spent years in
Glasgow and Liverpool. &#8220;Hullo, Jock,&#8221; the man said kindly,
&#8220;pretty bad, aren&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll fetch a doctor for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so, and the wounds were roughly dressed. Nothing
more was done for eight days, when the Scot managed to
attract the attention of some visiting officer to the fact that
his wounds were in a dreadful condition, septic and suppurating.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was furious,&#8221; said the Scot: &#8220;made no end of a
row about it, and I was attended to at once. I have nothing
to complain of about my treatment when in hospital in
Germany.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>From the <i>Daily News</i>, April 16, 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Here is a story vouched for by a young soldier now in
hospital in the North of England:&mdash;&#8220;I was shot in both
legs during the recent fighting. As I lay, helpless and almost
hopeless, for our lads had been pressed back, a German
officer, also wounded, crawled up to me. He spoke English
fluently, and it turned out that he had once worked in the
town from which I come. When I told him I was the last of
the family left to my widowed mother, and that I feared it
would settle her when she heard I had gone too, he said: &#8216;All
right, old chap; we&#8217;ll see what can be done.&#8217; As soon as
it was quite dark he got me to pull myself on to his back.
In this way he crawled to within earshot of our outposts,
and only left me and dragged himself in the direction of his
own lines when he knew my cry had been heard.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>From the same paper of April 11, 1918, I take the
story told by a naval prisoner exchanged through
Switzerland:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The sailor had one eye blown out and the other temporarily
damaged by a shell in a concentrated fire which sank his
destroyer in the battle of Jutland. He was picked up by an
already overcrowded British boat after swimming about for
an hour almost blind. Then a German destroyer ran alongside
and took aboard the whole boatload.</p>

<p>The voice of an officer hailed from the deck: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget the British way, lads, wounded first.&#8221; &#8220;He spoke
such good English that I took him for a Scottie,&#8221; said my
informant, &#8220;and I thought it was a British destroyer that
had picked us up. I was hauled aboard, and I saw him look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>at my face and turn away. &#8216;What&#8217;s the matter, Jock?&#8217; I
said. &#8216;I&#8217;m not a Jock,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I&#8217;m one of the Huns.&#8217;
&#8216;What, ain&#8217;t this a British ship?&#8217; says I. &#8216;Throw me back
into the sea, and let me take the chance of being picked up
by one of ours.&#8217; &#8216;It can&#8217;t be done, sonny,&#8217; he says. &#8216;You&#8217;ve
got to go to Germany. But you&#8217;ll be exchanged all right.
You&#8217;re disabled.&#8217; It seems he had a relative in London, and
knew England well. All the time British ships were chasing
us and shelling us; and he hung a lifebelt near me, and said:
&#8216;If the British Fleet sink us that will give you a bit of a
chance yet.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The following is from <i>Lloyd&#8217;s News</i>, May 12, 1918,
under the heading of &#8220;Back from the dead&#8221;:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Three years ago a Twickenham resident, Mrs. Maunders,
received official news from the War Office that her husband,
one of &#8220;The Old Contemptibles,&#8221; had been killed in action.</p>

<p>Thrown on her own resources, and having a small family to
keep, she struggled on, and a very good offer of marriage
came along and was accepted. A few days before the wedding a
letter came from the supposed dead husband, stating that he
was badly wounded and left for dead on the battlefield, but
was found by the enemy and nursed back to health.</p></div>

<p>The following is from a private letter: &#8220;I am happy
to be able to tell you that through the German Flying
Corps dropping a message, we heard of [my son&#8217;s]
safety early in July. He writes to us and appears to
be well and comfortable.... He was shot through
the neck. He has happily quite recovered after being
about four weeks in hospital. He has spoken only of
kindness and attention from doctors and nurses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again: &#8220;As you have probably heard by now, I am
a wounded prisoner of war.... I myself got my
shoulder rather badly smashed up by a machine gun
which knocked me out, and I lay in a shell hole for
about ten hours while our guns strafed like hell and
I expected every moment to be blown to bits. However,
I at last managed to crawl up and stagger along,
and as I was in German lines, ran into a lot of
Germans. They were awfully kind to me, gave me
food and drink and bound up my wound, and then
sent me along to the dressing station. I am at present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>in hospital in Belgium and expect to go to Germany
almost directly. My address at the back will find me.&#8221;
What follows from the same correspondent has some
bearing on the feeding in hospitals. &#8220;You mentioned
in your last letter whether you could send me anything.
Well, dear old chap, if you are feeling an
angel, plenty of good plain chocolate and other delicacies
would be awfully welcome, also some Gold Flake
cigarettes.&#8221; It was only &#8220;delicacies,&#8221; it will be
observed, that were asked for. This was in the middle
of 1917.</p>

<p>The next extract is from <i>Common Sense</i>, July 13,
1918:</p>

<p>&#8220;The following experience of an Ullet Road boy,
Private Arthur Bibby (6th S.W.B.), who is now
recovering from a severe wound, is recorded in the
Ullet Road Church <i>Calendar</i> for July:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The part of the line in which Private Bibby was placed
was subjected to a heavy bombardment, after which the
enemy delivered an attack. The order to retire was given
&#8220;and our section made for a road which led into a village,
but about a hundred yards up the road I received a bullet
wound which passed under the shoulder-blade and pierced a
portion of the lung.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Private Bibby was forced to lie down by the side of
the road, and shortly afterwards an advance party of
the Germans came along delivering their attack. The
first wave swept past, but of those who followed one
stopped to give Private Bibby a cigarette, another took
off his wounded foe&#8217;s equipment and made it into a
pillow for his head, and put his water-bottle within
reach, while a third made a pad out of his field dressing
with which he staunched the wound. As he turned
and followed his comrades, he assured his patient that
the Red Cross would come soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;A German Red Cross orderly came up shortly afterwards,
and was engaged in dressing the wound when
the order came for the Germans to retire before a
British counter-attack. &#8216;About ten minutes after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
last had passed down the road our lads, counter-attacking,
were creeping up the road, and it was not
long before the R.A.M.C. lifted me on a stretcher and
took me to the advanced dressing station.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We congratulate Private Bibby on the recovery
he is making from a severe wound, and are glad that
he is able to bear this testimony of gratitude to a company
of unknown but chivalrous foes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, of course, well known that the Northcliffe
Press refuses to print experiences of this kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of our wounded have passed through the
same conditions of captivity and deliverance. They
bear witness to the honourable conduct of the German
Army doctors (majors). Here, for example, is one of
the stories that I have heard: &#8216;I found myself in a
ditch after the battle, unable to move. A German
doctor came by; he gave me bread and coffee and
promised to come back in the evening if he could, or
next day. That night and the following day passed
without my seeing any one; the time seemed long. In
the evening he came: &#8216;I had not forgotten you,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;but I have had no time.&#8217; He had me carried
away and gave me careful attention.&#8217;&#8221; (<i>La Guerre
vue d&#8217;une Ambulance</i>, par L&#8217;Abb&eacute; F&eacute;lix Klein,
Aumonier de l&#8217;Ambulance am&eacute;ricaine, p.&nbsp;80.)</p>

<p>The writer continues: &#8220;Facts of this nature deserve
to be recorded. Amidst this setting loose of horrors
and hates it would be well to lay stress on some of
those deeds which are able to soften the soul. This
morning I see that an article has been passed in one of
the most widely read French journals recommending
that no prisoners should be made in forthcoming
battles, but that our enemies should be &#8216;struck down
like wild beasts,&#8217; &#8216;butchered like swine&#8217;! Nothing,
not even the sack of Senlis, nothing justifies such outbursts
of fury.&#8221; The French soldiers, M. L&#8217;Abb&eacute;
indicates, confine their denunciations to the Prussian
regulars and speak well of the reserves. &#8220;They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>men like us, married men, fathers of families, fair-minded.&#8221;
But for the doctors there is often a good
word: &#8220;Le major allemand est venu, nous a soign&eacute;s,
nous a donn&eacute; du caf&eacute;, du pain.&#8221; &#8220;Le major nous a
soign&eacute;s et donn&eacute; de la soupe.&#8221; There was however,
much plundering. The armies which do not plunder
are indeed <i>rar&aelig; aves</i>. &#8220;The animosity of the English
against the enemy,&#8221; says the Abb&eacute;, &#8220;is greater even
than ours.&#8221; &#8220;In the evening,&#8221; runs one narrative,
&#8220;the soldiers of the 101st put me in the wood where
were many wounded Frenchmen and a German
captain, wounded the day before. He suffered, he too,
poor man (le pauvre malheureux).&#8221; When the
Germans came, &#8220;some looked askance,&#8221; but the
captain said the Frenchmen had been kind, and when
the Germans had taken him they came back and
attended to the French. It was a bad time in the
retreat, but French and German wounded shared the
same fate. (l.c., p.&nbsp;98.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whose Fault?</span></h3>

<p>The poor soldiers, obliged to obey orders under
penalty of death, defending (as they believe) their
homes from wanton attack, are surely, in the mass,
but little to blame. The blame rests elsewhere. A
body of Russian prisoners was brought into a village
in East Prussia. The sufferings of the inhabitants
during the invasion had made them bitter, and from
the crowd of onlookers there was a scornful outcry.
&#8220;At that one of the prisoners bent forward, shook his
head and said slowly, with great, sad eyes, &#8216;It is not
your fault, and it is not mine.&#8217;&#8221; (Dr. Elisabeth
Rotten in <i>Die Staatsb&uuml;rgerin</i>.) Looking at it all with
fresh knowledge, after more than three years of war,
I feel that this Russian spoke for all the peoples, &#8220;It
is not your fault, and it is not mine.&#8221; Meanwhile
there still goes on what my wounded friend, writing
from Rouen described as &#8220;this orgy of slaughter, this
incredible and criminal lunacy.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span><span class="smcap">An Order Against Kindness.</span></h3>

<p>A girl who, with others, was attending to the enemy
wounded, writes: &#8220;Doubtless we should have more
consolation among our little soldiers, since here <i>we
are forbidden to give little kindnesses and attention;</i>
but I believe that before the end we shall disobey the
order, because we put our hearts into our devotion and
our pity.&#8221; (<i>La Guerre vue d&#8217;une Ambulance</i>, p.&nbsp;116.)
It is a little startling to learn of orders against kindness
to enemy wounded. In a country one of whose chief
newspapers advocated slaughter of the enemy like
swine, such orders seem unwise. They can surely
scarcely be made except when we wilfully blind ourselves
and imagine that our enemies do not share our
humanity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Our Common Humanity.</span></h3>

<p>Here is a letter found on one of the German dead,
a man with &#8220;a good face, strong and kindly,&#8221; so wrote
the <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent. &#8220;My dearest Heart,&#8221;
runs the letter, &#8220;when the little ones have said their
prayers and prayed for their dear father, and have gone
to bed, I sit and think of thee, my love. I think of all
the old days when we were betrothed, and I think of all
our happy married life. Oh! Ludwig, beloved of my
soul, why should people fight each other? I cannot
think that God would wish it....&#8221;</p>

<p>These words of Austin Dobson were written of a
French sergeant in an earlier war, yet they serve
equally well for the German soldier in this. Strange
that we leave it to the dead to prove their brotherhood
and ours.</p>

<p>Philip Gibbs tells us how in a German dug-out he
picked up some letters. &#8220;They were all written to
&#8216;dear brother Wilhelm,&#8217; from sisters and brothers,
sending him their loving greetings, praying that his
health might be good, promising to send him gifts of
food and yearning for his home-coming.&#8221; They were
anxious, for here had been no news for some time.
&#8220;Every time the postman comes we hope for a little
note from you.&#8221; Can any generous heart think of that
anxious waiting unmoved? Shall we children of one
Life wait till we have wholly darkened each other&#8217;s
homes, and then call our handiwork peace?</p>

<p>But by that time, by the judgment of God, our eyes
will be opened.</p>

<p>It is we at home who seem to yield only to this dread
proof. With the fighters it is often different, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>have seen, and though the stories savour of repetition,
the repetition is surely worth while. I have aimed
here at no literary production, but simply at a collection
of facts that may reach the heart. &#8220;We sing,&#8221;
said a soldier from Baden, &#8220;to the accompaniment of
the piano&mdash;especially during the interval for dinner.
We have indeed entered into a tacit agreement with
the French to stop all fire between 12 and 1 o&#8217;clock,
so that they and we might not be disturbed when we
feed.&#8221; (<i>Zeitung am Mittag</i>, as quoted in the <i>Daily
Chronicle</i>, November 10, 1914.) &#8220;One of our teachers,
a lieutenant in the R.F.A., who has been out most of
the time, had a few days&#8217; leave some weeks ago. He
said to the school, assembled to do him honour, &#8216;Boys,
do not believe the stories you read about the Germans
in the newspapers. Whatever they may have done at
the beginning of the war, the German is a brave and
noble soldier, and after the war we must be friends.&#8217;&#8221;
(From a private letter.) A soldier writes that a diary
he kept was blown to bits by a shell. He gave what
remained of it to a wounded German who pleaded for
it. He had met many German Socialists in the fighting.
&#8220;It is a blessing to meet such men and amid
all the slaughter brought about by our present system,
it seems heaven upon earth.&#8221; (<i>Labour Leader</i>, June
24, 1915.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Are We Always Chivalrous?</span></h3>

<p>It will only be making the <i>amende honorable</i> if we
do our best now to spread reports of good deeds of the
enemy, for in the early stages of the war we
deliberately deleted them from messages, and we have
certainly done a great deal to conceal them ever since.
Writing to the <i>Times</i> in October, 1914, Mr. Herbert
Corey, the American correspondent, said: &#8220;The
<i>Times</i> leader quotes the <i>Post</i> as charging that I &#8216;flatly
made the charge that dispatches had been altered for
the purpose of hiding the truth and blackening the
German character.&#8217; I do not recollect this phrase.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>I did charge that dispatches of German atrocities were
permitted to go through unaltered, and that sentences
in other dispatches in which credit was given the
Germans for courtesy and kindness were deleted. I
abide by that statement.&#8221;</p>

<p>There have been many angry references to unfair
German attempts to influence neutral opinion. A
letter such as Mr. Corey&#8217;s makes me able to understand
why some neutrals have accused England of the
very same unfairness. There is other testimony to the
same effect. Mr. Edward Price Bell, London Correspondent
of the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>, has, in a
pamphlet published by Fisher Unwin, indicted the
British censorship in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I call the censorship chaotic because of the chaos in its
administration. I call it political because it has changed or
suppressed political cables. I call it discriminatory because
there are flagrant instances of its not holding the scales evenly
between correspondents and newspapers. I call it unchivalrous
because it has been known to elide eulogies of enemy decency
and enemy valour. I call it destructive because its function
is to destroy; it has no constructive function whatever. I call
it in effect anti-British and pro-German because its tendency&mdash;one
means, of course, its unconscious tendency&mdash;often is to
elevate the German name for veracity and for courage above
the British. I call it ludicrous, because it has censored such
matter as Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;Recessional&#8221; and Browning&#8217;s poetry.
I call it incompetent because one can perceive no sort of
collective efficiency in its work. And because of the sum of
these things I give it the final descriptive&mdash;&#8220;incredible.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily
News</i>, January 7, 1916.</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that people often <i>fear</i> to tell of
German good deeds. An acquaintance of mine told me
that his boy got decorated for bringing in a badly
wounded comrade from near the German trenches. A
little shamefacedly my informant went on: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mind telling <i>you</i>, but I <i>shouldn&#8217;t like it to be known
generally here</i>, that I know the Germans act well sometimes.
My boy wrote he would have had no chance,
but he heard the Germans give the order to cease fire.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>My informant evidently feared the neighbours would
call him pro-German if he told this to them, but he
thought he might venture to tell a pacifist.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>One notices this fear sometimes in rather amusing
ways. In a railway compartment with me were a loud-mouthed
patriotic woman &#8220;war-worker&#8221; and a mere
soldier back from the front. I&#8217;m afraid I got a little
at loggerheads with the war-worker, who adopted in
argument a kind of furious grin which revealed a
formidable row of teeth that in my mind-picture of her
have become symbolically almost gigantic. I turned
for relief to the mere soldier, and while the train was
moving we had a pleasant dip into soldier philosophy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that there&#8217;s good and
bad everywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known bad Germans,
and I&#8217;ve known Germans to look after our wounded as
well as a British Tommy could look after his chum.&#8221;
There was more to this effect, but whenever the train
stopped and our voices became audible to others, we
were silent. The fear of that row of teeth was, I think
in both our hearts, and I could see the mere soldier
looking timid before them.</p>

<p>Fair play to the enemy&#8217;s character is a concession
not quite so easy to the average Englishman as he
supposes. &#8220;The Anglo-Saxon race has never been
remarkable for magnanimity towards a fallen foe.&#8221;
Just now, when we are inclined to be almost afraid of
the excess of chivalry which possesses us, there may be
useful corrective in these words of Lieutenant-General
Sir William Butler, K.C.B. There has been much
searching of old history books of late to find out what
was said in the days of Tacitus against the Germans.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
(What Tacitus said in their favour is not considered.)
Perhaps on the other side there are investigators
searching their history books for ancient opinions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>English. &#8220;Strike well these English,&#8221; said Duke
William to his Normans, &#8220;show no weakness towards
these English, for they will have no pity for you.
Neither the coward for running well, nor the bold man
for fighting well will be better liked by the English,
nor will any be more spared on either account.&#8221;
Butler approved this verdict. We shall not readily
agree with him. Yet he did not speak without cause:
he had known an English general kick the dead body
of an African King, who &#8220;was a soldier every inch of
him,&#8221; and he had known the colonists spit upon an
African chief brought bound and helpless through
Natal. (&#8220;Far Out,&#8221; p.&nbsp;131.) I believe myself there
is a great and ready generosity in the hearts of the
English people, but he must surely be a man invariably
on the &#8220;correct&#8221; side who has not more than once
come across the official Englishman who could be a
bully to those in his power.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some British Opinions.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;I am disgusted by the accounts I see in the papers
of the inferiority of Germans as soldiers. Don&#8217;t
believe one word of it. They are quite splendid in
every way. Their courage, efficiency, organisation,
equipment and leading are all of the very best, and
never surpassed by any troops ever raised. They come
on in masses against our trenches and machine guns,
and come time after time, and they are never
quiescent, but always on the offensive. I am full of
admiration for them, and so are all who know anything
about them. It is a pity that such fine soldiers should
have behaved so badly in Belgium and here; they have
behaved badly, there is no doubt about it, but nothing
like what is said of them&mdash;any way in parts I have been
through.&#8221; These words from a General Officer commanding
a brigade occur in a letter published in the
<i>Times</i> of November 19, 1914. Yet these &#8220;quite
splendid&#8221; fighters are the men of whom a learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
professor appointed by the Government has written
that they are &#8220;rotten to the core.&#8221; There is some
discrepancy here. &#8220;They are great workers, these
Germans,&#8221; wrote Philip Gibbs (<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, July
5, 1916), &#8220;and wonderful soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An officer of the <i>Sydney</i> gave a quite enthusiastic
account of the officers of the <i>Emden</i>. &#8216;Vitthoef, the
torpedo lieutenant, was a thoroughly nice fellow.
Lieutenant Schal was also a good fellow and half
English. It quite shook them when they found that
the captain had asked that there be no cheering on
entering Colombo, but we certainly did not want cheering
with rows of badly wounded men (almost all
German) laid out in cots on the quarter deck. Captain
von M&uuml;ller is a very fine fellow.... The day he was
leaving the ship at Colombo, he came up to me on
the quarter-deck and thanked me in connection with
the rescue of the wounded, shook hands and saluted,
which was very nice and polite of him.... Prince
Hohenzollern was a decent enough fellow. In fact,
we seemed to agree that it was our job to knock one
another out, but there was no malice in it.&#8217; This is
the ideal fighting, &#8216;with no malice in it.&#8217; It has
been achieved by many English and Germans, and that
gives hope for the future. Let us make the most,
not the least, of what points towards a better understanding....
At the beginning of November &#8216;Eye-Witness&#8217;
records how English prisoners had been
sheltered by the Germans in cellars to protect them
from the bombardment of their own side. An Anglo-Indian
tells of a wounded havildar who was noticed
by a German officer. &#8216;The German officer spoke to
him in Hindustani, asking him the number of his regiment,
and where he came from. He bound up his
wounds, gave him a drink, and brought him a bundle
of straw to support his head. This will be remembered
to the credit side of our German account.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wounded officer addressed some students at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>of our universities. He protested humorously that he
was not a &#8216;pro-German,&#8217; and then spoke up for a fair
view of the enemy. When he was being carried into
hospital, he noticed an anti-aircraft gun just outside
the hospital. This struck him as, to say the least,
unwise. He expected the hospital to be shelled, and
this occurred. He did not blame the Germans. On
another occasion a farm near the firing line was used
for first aid. It was not obviously a hospital and was
fired on. The Commanding Officer sent a note to Von
Kluck to explain matters, and the farm was never
after exposed to fire.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He had seen a church damaged
by German shell fire, but this was one which he had
himself seen used by the French for observation purposes.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The same officer uttered a warning against
believing all that was in the &#8216;Tommies&#8217; letters. At
one time when he was censoring letters, one passed
through his hands from a Tommy only just arrived
in France, and never in the firing line. He described
an immense battle in which the English did wonders
and he himself had marvellous duties to perform. As
far as the military situation was concerned the letter
was quite harmless, so it was allowed to go through.
It was something like the intelligence to the publication
of which the Press Bureau &#8216;does not object.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In her book, &#8220;My War Experiences on Two Continents,&#8221;
Miss Macnaughten writes of the Germans:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>&#8220;Individually, I always like them, and it is useless
to say I don&#8217;t. They are all polite and grateful, and
I thought to-day, when the prisoners were surrounded
by a gaping crowd, that they bore themselves very
well.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;127). Again, &#8220;I found one young German
with both hands smashed. He was not ill enough to
have a bed, of course, but sat with his head fallen
forward trying to sleep on a chair. I fed him with
porridge and milk out of a little bowl, and when he
had finished half of it he said, &#8216;I won&#8217;t have any more.
I am afraid there will be none for the others.&#8217;&#8221; (p.&nbsp;37.)
Unfortunately, Miss Macnaughten too readily accepted
war stories. She writes of &#8220;country houses&#8221; where
he heard German prisoners here lived in luxury, &#8220;and
they say girls are allowed to come and play lawn tennis
with them.&#8221; The humour of this will be apparent
to any who have visited internment camps. Lawn
tennis was, however, possible at some camps, both here
and in Germany&mdash;there were seven courts at Ruhleben.
Some of the atrocity stories many of us will recognise
as not so reliable as Miss Macnaughten supposed.
It is her personal experiences which are important,
and, like the Scotchman<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> (whom she quotes) she has,
not hatred, but respect, for the Germans whom she
herself meets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Ease of Accusation.</span></h3>

<p>Again and again, everywhere, we find readiness to
accept stories against the enemy on very slender
evidence. At the time of the loss of our three cruisers
I saw in one of the better newspapers a large heading,
&#8220;German Treachery. Fighting under the Dutch
Flag.&#8221; I looked down the columns for evidence. No
mention of such a circumstance in the official report,
none in the letter from the chief correspondent; but at
last I found that some one at Harwich had &#8220;heard of&#8221;
such an incident. We must remember that only cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>and clear intellects are likely at such a time to give
an accurate account of facts. Between others mutual
recrimination may readily arise. An officer on
H.M.A.S. <i>Sydney</i> wrote after the attack on the
<i>Emden</i>: &#8220;It was very interesting talking to some of
the German officers afterwards. On the first day they
were on board one said to me, &#8216;You fire on the white
flag.&#8217; I at once took the matter up, and the torpedo-lieutenant
and an engineer (of the <i>Emden</i>) both said
emphatically, &#8216;No, that is not so; you did not fire on
the white flag.&#8217; But we did not leave it at that. One
of us went to the captain, and he got from Captain
von M&uuml;ller an assurance that we had done nothing of
the kind, and that he intended to assemble his officers
and tell them so.&#8221; Note how readily on the other
side, amongst those less responsible or less cool-headed,
a tale may grow up against <i>us</i>. Let us observe in
considering tales against them the same caution that
we should wish them to exercise in considering tales
against us.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Troops in Occupation.</span></h3>

<p>Witnesses from Brussels and from Ghent have
spoken well of the personal behaviour of both soldiers
and officers. A neutral correspondent writes in the
<i>Times</i> of January 28, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;On the whole it cannot be said that the behaviour of the
German officers and soldiers towards the population of Ghent
is bad. When the German troops entered the city, strict
injunctions were given them to refrain from pillaging, and
to pay for everything they bought in the shops, very much
to the disgust of many....&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Gabriel Mourey has written an account of his
custody of the Palais de Compi&egrave;gne during the invasion.
The <i>Times</i> review of this book is so interesting that
I propose to give some extracts from it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>First the palace served as the general headquarters of the
British Army during the last stage of the strategic retreat to
the Marne; and in the closing days of August, M. Mourey
looked out of his window to see Generals French and Joffre
walking up and down the terrace in consultation, while in
the park English soldiers were shaving themselves calmly
before little pieces of broken mirror. In a night they had
left Compi&egrave;gne, blowing up the Louis XV. bridge (&#8220;utterly
improved,&#8221; and therefore no great loss). On the next day
came the Uhlans, by no means so terrible as they had been
painted.... Von Kluck was to make his headquarters
there for a day, and the first announcement of the doubtful
honour was brought by an engineer lieutenant, who came to
make a wireless installation on the palace roof. He was very
quick, but he found time to inform the conservator that his
name was Maurin, that it was a French name. He repeated
it many times, &#8220;C&#8217;est un nom fran&ccedil;ais,&#8221; and he was plainly
proud of it. Then came Von Kluck himself, asking in polite
and excellent French that he might be shown over the palace.
Of him M. Mourey draws a by no means unattractive picture,
urbane yet reserved, with real admiration for the treasures
of the Palace, discreetly murmuring &#8220;Je sais&#8221; at the close
of every explanation, not offensively, but as though some long
forgotten memory had returned to him, making his frequent
&#8220;Kolossal&#8221; sound in his conductor&#8217;s ears as gently as the
continual &#8220;Very nice&#8221; of the British Officer, and, his visit
over, promising that respect should be paid to the monument
of Imperial France.</p>

<p>But Von Kluck could not stay. He was followed by Von
Marwitz, no less polite, no less sympathetic to M. Mourey&#8217;s
natural fears, and generous enough to write and sign a
proclamation forbidding his troops to lay their hand upon the
palace. He, too, went his way. Von Kluck&#8217;s Quartermaster-General
seized the opportunity of making a private levy of
5,000f. upon the town before he sped like Gehazi after his
master&#8217;s chariot. Then ensued the brief reign of lesser men,
stupid, brutal, blustering, bullying, insulting, because they
feared a civilisation which they could not understand.</p></div>

<p>I think we know such men, and many privates know
such men, elsewhere than in the German army.
Germany may have cultivated them in greater
numbers&mdash;that is highly probable&mdash;but they are rife
everywhere, and under favourable circumstances they
thrive exceedingly.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>Their insolent arrogance culminated in a certain aide-de-camp,
who arrived post-haste to say that the Palace must
be instantly made ready to receive an Excellence <i>par
excellence</i>. A man of imagination this aide-de-camp, for
when at his command M. Mourey showed him over the
palace and pointed out the gaps in the collections made by
the soldiers&#8217; pilfery, he said with an all-explanatory air,
&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you get souvenirs ready for the officers?&#8221;
The Excellence whom this right Brandenburger heralded was
no less than the Kaiser himself, and M. Mourey is convinced
that it is to the Imperial intention that the safety of Compi&egrave;gne
is owing. It may be: but we prefer to think that
honourable foes such as Von Kluck and Von Marwitz had
their share in the unusual consummation.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></div>

<p>&#8220;The Irish Nuns at Ypres&#8221; gives an account of
their experiences by a member of the Community. In
a review (May 27, 1915), the <i>Times</i> Literary Supplement
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>For us in England it is hard to realise the feeling of
sickening anxiety with which, on October 7, these defenceless
ladies witnessed the arrival in Ypres of the devastators
of Belgium. On this occasion, apart from a certain amount
of looting, the Germans behaved &#8220;pretty civilly,&#8221; and the
Abbey had nothing to complain of but want of bread.</p></div>

<p>Another French account of the invaders in Northern
France is given by Gabriele and Margerita Yerta,
&#8220;Six Women and the Invasion.&#8221; Their experiences
were variable. &#8220;It is clear,&#8221; writes a reviewer in the
<i>Nation</i>, &#8220;that Herr Major, and &#8216;Barlu,&#8217; and
&#8216;Crafleux&#8217; and the two &#8216;model Prussians,&#8217; who
replenished the house with coal and provisions, and
offered the ladies game they had shot, only sinned by
their over-gallantry. But things changed for the worse
with the coming of a hundred Death&#8217;s Head Hussars
and Lieutenant von Bernhausen.... Nothing
very outrageous is recorded, but there was dragooning,
inquisition, drunkenness. Bernhausen&#8217;s reign lasted
two months.&#8221; As to outrages on women, Madame
Yerta writes: &#8220;To be sure there were rapes, but,
thanks be to God, these were few, and they took place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>at the beginning of the invasion.... I must
confess that many a woman was the victim of her own
imprudence.&#8221; The book is, naturally, fiercely anti-German,
its facts are, however, those of any war
story.</p>

<p>Again, &#8220;On the whole the Germans behaved well
at St. Quentin. Their rule was stern but just, and
although the civil population had been put on rations
of black bread, they got enough, and it was not, after
all, so bad.&#8221; This testimony is the more noteworthy
because, &#8220;as one of the most important bases of the
German Army in France the town was continually
filled with troops of every regiment, who stayed a little
while and then passed on.&#8221; (Philip Gibbs, &#8220;The
Soul of the War,&#8221; p.&nbsp;152.) It is a little startling to
read some more that Mr. Gibbs has to say. French-women
were ready to sell themselves to German
soldiers, and &#8220;such outrageous scenes took place that
the German order to close some of the caf&eacute;s was hailed
as a boon by the decent citizens, who saw the women
expelled by order of the German commandant with
enormous thankfulness.&#8221; I am not so surprised
at this now as when I first read it. An English soldier
has since told me that the &#8220;silliness&#8221; (as he called
it) of women for soldiers leads them, in more cases
than he could have imagined, to bestow themselves on
either friend or enemy. Women with child had said
to him quite proudly that it was by a German soldier!</p>

<p>From a private letter: &#8220;One of the party is a
French officer who tells the tale. After the Marne
retreat he was crossing over the territory evacuated by
the Germans, and made inquiry of the villagers who
had housed the enemy, how they had been treated,
what barbarities had been committed, and so forth.
The villagers were surprised. The Germans had
behaved like gentlemen, had paid for what they used,
and had treated them with perfect courtesy. What,
no looting? On the contrary, the German officer had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>a soldier shot for a very small act of pillage....
&#8216;We&#8217;re soldiers, not robbers,&#8217; he said.&#8221; I cannot
vouch for this story, but it gives just the same impression
as the account given by Dr. Scarlett-Synge (see
pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_149">149</a>ff). It is also remarkably similar to experiences
recounted by C.&nbsp;A. Winn (Baron Headley) who
was with the Prussians in 1870. (&#8220;What I saw of
the War,&#8221; p.&nbsp;44.) When he himself had taken some
vegetables from a garden, he was told by his officer
friends that any sort of pillage was the &#8220;greatest
offence a friend of the Prussians could be guilty of.&#8221;
And Mr. Winn speaks of &#8220;the many instances of the
remarkable efforts of the authorities of the Prussian
army to prevent plunders by their soldiers.&#8221; It must
be remembered that deliberate destruction for military
reasons, or as punishment (carried out by all armies)
is very different from theft. I do not for a moment
suppose that this standard is always reached by the
German armies. That it has often been aimed at is
something to remember.</p>

<p>I may add here a rather interesting quotation from
Colonel F.&nbsp;N. Maude&#8217;s book, &#8220;War and the World&#8217;s
Life.&#8221; On page 11 he writes: &#8220;I do not suggest
that life in the Prussian army has at any time been
ideal, but I do assert, from personal knowledge, that
relatively to their respective stages of civilisation the
treatment of the Prussian soldier, since 1815, has at
all times been fairer and more humane than in any
other army. The fact is proved by the very high
standard of discipline maintained, together with the
extraordinary absence of military crime which has so
long distinguished it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am reminded, too, of one of the first experiences
of a friend of mine in France. He reached a village
through which the Uhlans had passed. Had the
inhabitants any complaints of their behaviour? None
whatever.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Their only indignation was directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>against some English soldiers who (if their story be
correct) had behaved abominably. It was a curious
shock of reality for my friend. He realised that sometimes
the enemy might behave well, and sometimes
bad stories of English soldiers might be circulated
(even amongst Allies). I am quite sure that no
soldiers in the world would, in general, have more
natural humanity than the British, and perhaps none
would have as much. I contend only against the
belief that one side is impeccable, and the other hopelessly
barbarian.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">From the International Review; a Common
Memorial.</span></h3>

<p>Here are a few extracts from the <i>International
Review</i>, a periodical published at Z&uuml;rich, and with
co-operators in Russia, Denmark, Germany, Austria,
Italy, America, Great Britain. &#8220;The yearning
of human beings towards mutual understanding needs
to-day a new organ for its expression.&#8221; Hence this
review&mdash;a review naturally pronounced pro-German by
our Junker Press, since it presents, amongst other
things, moderate statements of the German standpoint.
The only internationalism which this Press
can recognise is one that is exclusively English. So
exactly, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, do German and English
chauvinism coincide. The extracts which follow are
taken from the first number of the review. &#8220;Under
the title, &#8216;German-French Chivalry,&#8217; the <i>Volksstimme</i>,
of Frankfurt a.M. (June 19, 1915), describes
the dedication of a memorial to three thousand dead
at Sedan on June 12. The leaders of the German
army were present, and the French authorities
officially shared in the proceedings. The short inscriptions
on the simple monuments are in both French
and German. They refer alike to the seventeen
hundred French and the thirteen hundred Germans
who fell on August 27 during the battle on the heights
of Noyers.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span><span class="smcap">A Story from France.</span></h3>

<p>From <i>L&#8217;Action Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, Paris (June 12, 1915), is
cited a description of the poignancy of war, of which
the following is a translation:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>There had been a fierce fight in front of a fortress. Many
dead lay on the ground, and a few wounded who were dying.
In the night we heard weak cries, &#8216;Kamerad, Kamerad!&#8217;
We answered, thinking it was a German who wished to give
himself up. The cries were repeated. We thought of treachery,
and each took his stand in readiness. Suddenly, there came
in pure French: &#8216;Camerades Fran&ccedil;ais!&#8217; &#8216;What is it?&#8217; &#8216;A
wounded man lies near you.&#8217; &#8216;No.&#8217; &#8216;Yes, in front of the
trench.&#8217; &#8216;We have just made a round, and found only dead.&#8217;
&#8216;Yes, but there <i>is</i> a wounded man there who is calling. Can
you not look for him?&#8217; &#8216;No.&#8217; And then in the silence we
hear again, &#8216;Kamerad, Kamerad!&#8217; The German officer
speaks again, very politely: &#8216;French comrades, may we go
to look for the wounded man?&#8217; An inflexible &#8216;No&#8217; is the
answer. Is not some trick concealed under his apparent
humanity and his persistence? &#8216;Well, then,&#8217; calls the German
again, &#8216;go yourself and look; we shall not shoot.&#8217; Can we
trust a German&#8217;s word, after all that they have done? But
there is no long delay. A man from Lille springs forward:
&#8216;All right, I will go to fetch him,&#8217; he says. &#8216;I will go with
him,&#8217; I say to the Lieutenant. The leader of my squadron
brings some others. The wounded man calls: &#8216;Kamerad!
Do not kill me!&#8217; We reassure him as to our intentions, and
as he has a shattered hip we carry him to our lines, and on
the way in spite of his suffering, he keeps on repeating with
every kind of modulation, &#8216;Good comrade.&#8217; He was a young
man, scarcely eighteen years old, of the 205th Infantry.</p>

<p>I call to the enemy trenches: &#8216;We have brought in one
wounded man, are there any others there?&#8217; &#8216;Yes. 20 metres
further to the right.&#8217; We look round. &#8216;There are none there,
only dead.&#8217; &#8216;Wait, we will give you some light.&#8217; A few
words in German which we cannot understand. Will they
simply shoot us down? Suddenly two splendid rockets go
up: we can see as if it were midday. We are half a dozen
marines and are standing twenty metres from the German
trenches. On the other side of the wire entanglements an
officer and men, behind the breastwork pointed helmets and
caps. All remains quiet. We look round carefully. &#8216;Nothing.
There are only corpses here. We are going back, you go
back, too.&#8217; &#8216;Merci, camerades fran&ccedil;ais!&#8217; calls the officer,
and his men repeat the greeting of their superior. As soon
as we are behind our breastwork our Lieutenant gives a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>command loud enough to be heard at sixty metres. &#8216;In the
air&mdash;Fire!&#8217; From over there once more, &#8216;Thank you,
comrades,&#8217; as answer to our salvo, and all falls back once
more into the silence of the night; the work of death can go
on again. But for this one night not a shot was heard around
us.</p></div>

<p>How much sanity is there in a world that sets such
men to kill each other, and eggs them on to hate?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Help of &#8220;Alien Enemies.&#8221;</span></h3>

<p>In Germany (as already mentioned in Chap. IV.) is
a &#8216;Committee for advice and help to natives and
foreigners in State and international affairs.&#8217; It deals
with those of all nationalities, and one branch of it
corresponds in many ways to the similar Emergency
Committee in England for assistance of Germans,
Austrians and Hungarians in distress.</p>

<p>What, however, is most striking is the number of
cases of individual kindness shown by Germans to
&#8220;alien enemies.&#8221; The minds of many might be
cleared on this subject if they would read a charming
and unpretentious little book, &#8220;An English Girl&#8217;s
Adventures in Hostile Germany,&#8221; by Mary Littlefair,
published by John Long, Ltd. The authoress saw
and heard absurd Press charges on the other side, and
something, too, of the irrational hatred of war-time,
but the little book is a record of almost nothing but
kindness, and gives fresh hope to those who had begun
to despair of human nature.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Here are two cases of
singular beauty from Nauheim. A postman &#8220;happened
to know of a poor English lady whose funds had
come to an end, and who had in consequence offered
to wash up the crockery at her pension in return for
her board and lodging, and he told her one morning
that he had forty pounds saved up which she should
have, and welcome, if she was in need.&#8221; The case
of the bath-chair woman was not less touching and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>generous, for she and her husband, a crossing-sweeper,
also put their savings at the disposal of an invalid lady
his wife used to wheel out every day, telling her that,
though their cottage was only small, they did possess
a tiny spare room, and they would be so glad if she
would come to them as their honoured guest, supposing&mdash;as
at present seemed likely&mdash;the English
would have to spend the winter in Nauheim; they
would indeed do their best to make her happy and
comfortable.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>On more than one occasion in the railway trains
the &#8220;enemy&#8221; character of Miss Littlefair and those
who were with her was revealed, but no unkindness
was shown. The last occasion was in October, 1914.
&#8220;&#8216;Shall you have to travel farther, or does your
journey end in Munich,&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; I said, &#8216;we hope to
go on to Switzerland to-morrow.&#8217; &#8216;O, how delightful!
You are lucky. It is such a beautiful country.
Tell me, are you foreigners by any chance&mdash;American,
or perhaps English?&#8217; she queried. &#8216;English,&#8217; I
replied. The truth was out, and I looked to see a
change of feeling reflected in her pleasant, winsome
face; but her expression remained as kind and as interested
as before, and her manner as cordial, so I told
her more about ourselves, as there was no longer any
need of reserve, and she had told me so much of their
affairs.&#8221; There was, of course, the usual patriotic
bias, but it was expressed with real good feeling.
&#8220;&#8216;Of course, we don&#8217;t hold the English people personally
responsible for the war,&#8217; she said, &#8216;but we
think that England<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> has behaved very shabbily. It
is very grieving, though, that the two countries should
be at war.&#8217; She had two or three English friends,
and told me about them till our arrival in Munich,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>where our confidences were necessarily cut short, and
we took an affectionate leave of one another.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;123.)</p>

<p>The following incident also shows simple folk made
clear-sighted by kindness of heart: &#8220;On another
occasion Christine and one of the ladies in our hotel
went into a shop to buy some beautiful lace which
was being sold at half-price. &#8216;We have to sell it
cheaply because of the war,&#8217; explained the assistant:
&#8216;ach! it is terrible! We never wanted this war, and I
am sure you did not either. You and I are not
enemies, it is ridiculous. Let us shake hands to show
we are friends. Yes!&#8217; And they did.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Good!
That handshake, let us hope, will outweigh many a
hysterical outburst on both sides.</p>

<p>An English schoolmaster was, with his wife and
family, in Germany at the outbreak of war. He
testifies to the quite wonderful kindness he received.
Almost daily he was taken by his hosts to other
houses, and at the <i>Kaffeeklatsch</i> which ensued
there was never anything but a finely chivalrous
courtesy. So grateful did the schoolmaster feel that
(just as with Germans befriended here) he felt he must
make some sort of return to the &#8220;enemy.&#8221; He
explained the situation, and obtained permission to
take two interned enemy nationals into his house.
They in their turn felt that movement of gratitude
which the preachers of hate refuse to believe in. They
wanted to make some return to the schoolmaster, for
schoolmasters are usually poor men. &#8220;If you do
that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall feel I am doing nothing.&#8221;
There was a dispute of kindness, and in the end a
<i>modus vivendi</i> of gratitude was arrived at. How
strange the methods of force seem by comparison. The
two men are now interned once more&mdash;surely a sorry
end to a story of such fine humanity.</p>

<p>From Mrs. K. Warmington: &#8220;There are two little
instances that stand out in my mind very clearly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>I think speak for themselves. The first relates to an
English lady, her husband, and her son, with whom I
made acquaintance at the English Consul&#8217;s office.
Later on I met the same lady at the American Consul&#8217;s
office; she was in deep distress, as her husband and
son had been arrested and put into prison. Through
the influence of an American that we met at an hotel,
we got a permit to go and see a military commandant
at the barracks to see if anything could be done for
them. When we arrived, he treated us most courteously,
and listened patiently to what we had to say.
He rang a doctor up on the telephone, and, as far as
we could make out, told the doctor to examine these
men, and to pronounce them ill. He then turned to
us, and told us to return in the afternoon, when he
would fetch them in his own motor-car, which he did.
He also gave us a paper asking the civil authorities to
do all they could to aid us to get away, shook hands,
and wished us a safe journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other instance relates more to myself. We
were at N&uuml;remberg, Bavaria. We had permission to
leave for Lindau, on the borders of Lake Constance,
on our way to Romanshorn in Switzerland. The
journey was a rather expensive one for me, as I had
very little money, little more indeed than a cheque,
which was valueless. A young German, who was
shortly going into the Navy, whom I had known only
about a month, hearing of my case came to me, and
gave me &pound;9 in English gold to enable me to travel
more comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was German, my mother English, and
my husband English. I was in Germany in 1914
from July 26 to August 26. As my son was of
military age, and I did not want him interned, I got
what influence I could to get him away. He was
finally released at the end of August, and we were
allowed to go on to Switzerland.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the course of 1915 an English born woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>returned to her husband in Munich. Her sister wrote
to me of the extreme kindness with which this lady
was received by her German friends. Many English
wives of interned men have gone to Germany to their
husband&#8217;s families, and one hears the same account of
extreme kindness. In Offenbach alone there are
twenty English wives with forty English born children.
<i>Special classes have been opened for them.</i> After all,
there are some German methods which are worthy of
imitation. There seems at times a danger of our
imitating what is <i>worst</i> in our enemies, partly as a
result of a desire to ignore what is better.</p>

<p>The letter which follows appeared in the <i>Times</i> of
September 2, 1914:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Sir,&mdash;Various rumours are finding their way into the German
papers respecting the harsh treatment which certain
Germans are said to have received in England. We British
subjects who are being kindly and hospitably treated by
Germans earnestly hope that these reports are, at any rate,
much exaggerated.</p>

<p>It is well that the British public should understand the
position of their fellow countrymen here. At the outbreak
of the war British subjects in out-of-the-way places were
given safe conducts to suitable centres, such as Baden-Baden,
and there allowed to choose places of abode according to
their tastes and means. Such restrictions as are put upon
their movements are in their own interests. The authorities
have exhorted the inhabitants publicly as well as by house
to house visitations to treat foreigners with respect and
courtesy, taking pride in thus proving their claim to a truly
high standard of civilisation, and the people have responded
nobly to this appeal. Not only have hotel and pension-keepers
done everything in their power to accommodate their
visitors, at the most reduced prices, giving credit in many
instances, but several cases have come to our notice in which
Germans have housed and fed English women and children,
who were perfect strangers to them, out of pure humanity
and good feeling.</p>

<p>You, sir, can imagine how galling it must be to these people
when they read in their papers of the very different treatment
alleged to have been shown to Germans in England, and how
painful and humiliating a position is thereby created for us
here. England has hitherto enjoyed such a high reputation
for chivalry and hospitality that tales to the contrary cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Germans a half incredulous shock. It it not too late for
England to prove that she is living up to her old standard
and that she refuses to be outdone in magnanimity towards
the stranger within her gates....</p>

<p>Some account may be given of a party of 190 Englishwomen
and 14 children who landed at Queenborough
on September 22, 1914. (<i>Times</i>, September 23, 1914.)
&#8220;... With one accord they spoke in terms of
praise, both of their treatment in Germany and of the
kindness shown to them on the journey.... &#8216;We
have received kindness everywhere,&#8217; said one of
a party from Dantzig. &#8216;The Germans have been
absolutely stunning to us.... I have not heard
of one English person being molested anywhere in
Germany.&#8217;&#8221; The Englishwomen did noble work on
their part, especially for the fugitives from East
Prussia. &#8220;One Sunday we fed and clothed 290 who
had come in without a rag to their backs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was arrested in Berlin as a Russian spy, because
a bomb had been found in the house next to mine,
and because a woman in the street said that she had
seen me putting bombs in my hat-box, and that she
had seen me with a Russian. I did, as a matter of
fact, know a Russian student, but he was not the
man she meant. I was taken to the police station
and searched twice in the same day. They kept me
in prison for two days and nights, giving me very bad
food, and then they released me because they had no
real evidence against me. When I came out,
strangely enough it was German people who gave
me hospitality until I was able to leave Berlin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Again, &#8220;The German women are crazy over our
Scottish troops and their kilts. Some of them used
to go out and give the prisoners cigarettes, chocolates
and flowers, but that has been forbidden now.&#8221;</p>

<p>A party of 178 who landed at Folkestone had varying
stories to tell. &#8220;Nothing could possibly be better
than the treatment we have received,&#8221; said one,
&#8220;everybody&mdash;official, police and public&mdash;treated us with
the greatest kindness and the utmost courtesy.&#8221;
&#8220;The Germans are brutes, absolute brutes,&#8221; said
another. Probably a third, who described both statements
as exaggerations, came nearer the average truth.
One of this same party described the kilts referred
to above as causing matronly indignation in Berlin.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Times</i> of September 24, 1914, appeared a
letter on the subject of English exiles in Berlin:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I have read with interest and approval the statements
of Englishwomen who have returned from Germany, as
reported in the <i>Times</i> to-day, with regard to the conduct of
the German people. As one of the party which arrived at
Queensborough by the special boat, I wish publicly to express
my warm appreciation not only of the considerate treatment
which the people of Berlin showed towards English
people there, but particularly to the splendid services rendered
to us by the American Embassy, which made all the
arrangements for our return, and by the Consular and municipal
authorities in Holland, who supplied us with food
during our journey through that country.</p>

<p>May I add that I went about in Berlin as freely as I can
now in London, and that at no time since the outbreak of
the war have I seen a single British subject molested.</p>

</div>

<p>Here also is a fact that should give us pause. In
a prisoner camp at Frankfurt a-Oder is a large building
erected as a place of entertainment and general meeting
hall. It is used by Russian prisoners, and <i>a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>contribution towards its erection was collected
by house-to-house visitation in Frankfurt.</i> To
appreciate this fact at its true significance we must
remember that Germany suffered from direct invasion
by Russia immediately on the outbreak of the war,
and that all the stories of atrocities and devastation
that we heard of Belgium were also told of East
Prussia.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old friend of our family,&#8221; a correspondent
writes, &#8220;has been residing in Bavaria over forty years.
He is an artist, and married a Bavarian lady. His
eldest son is a doctor in London, and two of his
daughters are married in London, but the father has
no difficulty in getting permits to paint in the Austrian
and German mountains, and still finds a sale for his
pictures in Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forty years is, I know, a long time, but not by any
means always sufficient to prevent persecution in the
present war. On my writing table is a little ivory
elephant. It was carved by a German who had been
forty years in the service of one British firm. He
was dismissed (a man over seventy) because of the
war. This is not a unique case. &#8220;N.S., clock-maker,
who had been here thirty-nine years, and
P.W., baker, fifty years. (He had two sons at the
front, and &#8216;the longer he thought the more the number
of his English grandchildren grew.&#8217;)&#8221; (See the Third
Report of the Emergency Committee for these and
other cases).</p>

<p>I do not in the least wish to suggest that there has
been little kindness on this side and much on the other.
I am simply trying to restore the balance. So far
(as is usual in war-time) the game of hatred has been
played with loaded dice. Let us welcome kindness
everywhere. Here, then, is a different kind of story
from one of the Friends&#8217; reports:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A young man, smart and erect three months ago when he
was in employment, intelligent, speaks and writes four languages,
with excellent references, now but a sad wreck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>wants to go to South Africa, where he has friends, but,
alas! the permit is refused&mdash;has written abroad to his father,
who is in a good position, for money, but it takes so long
to get a reply. His English landlady, though poor, &#8220;has been
so kind,&#8221; he had his last dinner three days ago from her. We
give temporary help, but if this money does not come before
January 1 he will have to go into camp. Quite willing to do
so, &#8220;but can we not give his poor landlady something?&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The kind landladies and other kind hearts exist,
thank God, on both sides.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> To enquire on which side
there are most would (even if we could do so without
bias) probably be profitless. The important point is
that the kind hearts on the other side are there, and
that a brotherhood of blessing will help the world more
than a brotherhood of revenge&mdash;if, indeed, this last
could be any brotherhood at all.</p>

<p>Miss G.&nbsp;H. writes: &#8220;I am particularly anxious to
do something for interned Germans. For four months
of the war I was in Germany with my mother, sister,
nephew and niece, and we were all most kindly treated
and helped in every possible way both by friends, by
my lawyer, my banker and the neighbouring peasants.
Also by all the guards and waiters along our journey
on November 21. Friends, peasants, and my lawyer
are still looking after my property in Germany, and
I have left everything in the hands of a neighbouring
peasant, who sends me accounts of it. I would like
to be able to do some kind acts here in return, and
for the furtherance of better relationships later on.&#8221;
Yet it can never be pleasant to be in an &#8220;enemy&#8221;
country. Miss H. writes further: &#8220;In spite of having
such unspeakable sympathy, really understanding
sympathy, shown me by not only friends, but the
common people&mdash;though I hardly like using this term,
as no one with so much fellow feeling could really be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>termed common&mdash;in spite of this kindness, I know so
well how one can suffer. Over there <i>we</i> are looked
upon in the same way that Germans are looked upon
here, as quite outside the pale of common morality.
Fully realising what this must mean for me, these
kindly Germans would go off into a day dream of
wonderment as to how <i>they</i> might feel in a similar
plight, and one ended up with the reflection, &#8216;Ja,
es ist halt jetzt die Zeit der M&auml;rtyrer&#8217; (it is indeed
the time of the martyrs once more).&#8221; Surely there
is something strangely poignant about the convinced
and steadfast martyrdom and self-sacrifice of both
sides. Surely the peoples who can thus offer themselves
in destroying each other must both have noble
gifts to give together one day in a nobler cause.</p>

<p>The following is from the <i>Nation</i> (Jan. 19, 1918):</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>A clergyman sends me the following. I think it best to
publish the story as it stands:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some years before the outbreak of war there lived in a
certain German town, now frequently raided by air squadrons,
an old Englishwoman. She was a semi-invalid; difficult and
cantankerous. Subject to illusions, she imagined that the good
nuns, who received her as an unremunerative paying guest,
were in league against her mangy, but beloved dog. Yet both
she and her dog continued to receive the half-humorous
tolerance of their benefactors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then came the 4th of August, 1914, and Miss X. passed
into the mists of war.</p>

<p>&#8220;A year later she emerged from the mists.</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter came, forwarded through a neutral in Switzerland;
but the letter was not from the pen of Miss X. It had
been dictated. Briefly, it said: &#8216;I am bed-ridden and
almost blind. I have hardly anything to live upon; and the
Germans will not let me go.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certain details were added which clearly established
identity to the recipient of the letter. There followed, on the
same sheet of paper, and in the same handwriting, a postscript:
&#8216;Sir, I have taken this poor Englishwoman into
my house. How can she live on 10 marks a month?</p>

<p class="signature">Yours, Fr&auml;ulein ...&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8220;Intervened the British Foreign Office and the American
Embassy. Then came another letter: &#8216;Sir, your efforts have
not been in vain....</p>

<p class="signature">Fr&auml;ulein ...&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is not the end of this incident of war. &#8216;Hate.&#8217;
had still its &#8216;uses.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sir. I thank you for your good letter and your very kind
question. All is paid, hospital and funeral. There were 30
marks left to have the grave a little arranged.</p>

<p class="signature">Fr&auml;ulein ...&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>My correspondent adds the following comment: &#8220;I was an
enemy, and ye took me in.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In Vienna newspapers there were in 1915 many
advertisements in which French, English, and Russian
natives offer their services as teachers, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>London Lady (Diploma) gives lessons.&mdash;L. Balman, VI Bez.
Gumpendorferstrasse 5, Th. 14.</p>

<p>Frenchman and Frenchwoman give instruction in French.&mdash;VIII,
Lerchengasse 10.</p>

<p>An Irishwoman, brought up in England, gives lessons.&mdash;Letters
to Miss Morris.</p></div>

<p>Such advertisements, we learn from the <i>International
Review</i> of July, 1915, appear daily in Vienna.</p>

<p>From <i>Die Hilfe</i>, June 22, 1915: &#8220;in a weekly
concert in Noyon the collaborators were Prof. Rivi&egrave;re,
Sergeant Bonhoff, and Director G&uuml;nzel. The performance
of the Frenchman from an organ composition of
his own was most effective.&#8221; There are, of course, also
exhibitions of narrow-mindedness. In Halle the
police forbade a performance because one of those who
took part was an &#8220;enemy alien.&#8221; (<i>Vorw&auml;rts</i>, June 1,
1915.) On the other hand, when some Italian
musicians complained of unjust dismissal, the court
awarded them damages of 700 marks. The
<i>Volksstimme</i>, of Frankfurt a.M., June 8, 1915,
writing of Italy, deprecates any hatred of Italians.
As soon as the responsible authorities had decided on
war, obedience was the duty of each Italian citizen,
just as of each German.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This outspoken deference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>to &#8220;responsible authority&#8221; is characteristically
German, but the doctrine is here applied with great
fairness. Some of our militarists apply it less fairly.
And, alas, when the Italian <i>Avanti</i> published an
article &#8220;Against the Blunders of International Hate,&#8221;
the wisdom of the Censor caused it to be largely
blanked out. The Censors seem to have strict orders
to keep us hating each other.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brotherhood Again.</span></h3>

<p>And yet&mdash;&#8220;We picked up scrappily the hint, however,
that &#8216;some of the Germans were all right.&#8217;&#8221;
This from an article in the <i>Times</i> on a homecomer
from the front. With unconscious self-revelation the
writer adds: &#8220;That somehow sounds depressing.
One has heard the opposite.&#8221; Just so, it is disconcerting
and depressing to have it suggested that the
enemy is a man very much like ourselves; it injures
our feeling of superiority. We &#8220;confess&#8221; any favourable
impression of him as if it were a fault of our own.
A correspondent of the <i>Petit Parisien</i> tells of the
capture of a German officer of Hussars, near Arras.
&#8220;I confess,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that the impression he
produced was rather favourable than otherwise.&#8221;
(<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, June 11, 1915.)</p>

<p>With others the confession is less reluctant.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>There&#8217;s one spot in Ploegsteert Wood that German shells
ought never to reach. It&#8217;s a grave with a carefully made
wooden cross on it, and the lettering says:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here lie two gallant German officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather unexpected,&#8221; said a civilian who was with
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they were brave,&#8221; said the major. &#8220;The Germans
aren&#8217;t always so bad. Five officers from my regiment were
missing one time, and we never even expected to find their
bodies. But when we drove the Germans back we found a
grave on which was marked: &#8216;Here lie five brave English
officers.&#8217; We identified them all, and their bodies were
taken back to England.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>We followed another sidewalk and came to a huge mound
covered with yellow flowers, which had been planted by the
English soldiers. On a neatly made cross at the head of the
mound an English soldier had patiently printed the words:
&#8220;Here lie seventeen German soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t an English grave in Ploegsteert Wood that
was better tended or more heavily beflowered than these
mounds of fallen Germans.&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">W.&nbsp;G. Shepherd</span>, Special
Correspondent of the United Press.</p>

<p class="sigdate"><i>Daily News</i>, June 1, 1915.</p>


<p class="tb">If all the episodes of this action were recorded they would
make a long as well as a grim narrative revealing the ghastliness,
the wild passion, the self-sacrifice, and the cool
cunning of such an hour or two of modern war.</p>

<p>Some of the tales of the men would have been incredible
except that I heard them from soldiers who told the truth
that lives on the lips of men who have seen very close into
the face of death.</p>

<p>It is, for instance, difficult to believe&mdash;yet true&mdash;that
amidst all this tumult and terror of noise one German
prisoner was taken as he sat very calmly in his dug-out
reading a book of religious meditations through gold-rimmed
spectacles. Perhaps it was the man&mdash;I only guess&mdash;in whose
pocket-book was found a letter to his wife saying, &#8220;The
position here is hellish, and death is certain. I only pray
that it may come soon.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Daily Telegraph</i>, August 16, 1915.</p></div>

<p>From Belfort in September came the report: &#8220;A
German aviator this morning flew over Belfort,
dropping a wreath on the spot where P&eacute;goud was
killed. The following inscription was placed on the
wreath: &#8216;To P&eacute;goud, who dies a hero. (Signed) His
Adversary.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is from the <i>Daily News</i> of October 9,
1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The parents of a Lance-Corporal in a Highland regiment
who was killed in the recent fighting have received particulars
about their son&#8217;s death from a German lady in Frankfurt-on-Main.</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s eldest brother was killed last year near Ypres
and she knows, she says, how glad they were to receive any
details of his death. Another brother, who is an officer in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>German army, had written from the front, begging her to
inform the dead soldier&#8217;s relatives of his fate.</p>

<p>In her letter the lady says: &#8220;Although we are enemies,
pain and mourning unite us. So thought my brother, too, for
he wrote everything about your son he could find out. I am
sure my brother and his comrades did all honour to their
enemies.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The next extract is from the <i>Nation</i> of November 13.
1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Soldiers are not reluctant to speak well of their foes. The
officer son of a friend of mine relates that beyond his line of
trenches is a German commemoration of a British advance in
the shape of a carefully wrought cross, bearing the inscription:
&#8220;Sacred to the memory of Lieutenants A&mdash;&mdash; and B&mdash;&mdash;
of the Staffordshire Regiment, who died like heroes.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>From a private letter: &#8220;What impresses one most
are the graveyards. All these are beautifully kept,
all the graves have been cared for, and no distinction
has been drawn between German, English, and
French, who lie side by side. &#8216;Hier ruht ein tapferer
Engl&auml;nder, gefallen im Luftkampf&#8217; (Here lies a
brave Englishman, fallen in the air fight), etc., etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i> of March 10, 1919, has the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>From a staff sergeant in Germany: &#8220;Here, in Germany,
an English officer with the &#8217;flu was nursed by his landlady,
who, when her patient was better, succumbed to its ravages.
Her daughter caught it from the mother, and is now lying
at death&#8217;s door. But merely &#8216;Huns,&#8217; I suppose.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The roll of honour in the chapel at New College,
Oxford, includes the names of three Germans, and the
words of charity: <i>Pro patria&mdash;Memento fratres in
Christo</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Way of New Russia.</span></h3>

<p>In reprisals of good we may learn something from
the new Russia. When the German prisoners were
set to work Kerensky said, &#8220;Prisoners or not, they
shall be paid at the same rate as other men,&#8221; and
they were. What was the result? Again the movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>of gratitude, which is so potent a force, if only
we would believe it. <i>The German prisoners presented
half their wages to the Russian Red Cross.</i> I have to
rely on private information for this.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thoughts From the Other Side.</span></h3>

<p>The thoughts of the others are much like our own&mdash;that
is the difficult truth we have to learn. It is a
truth that is absolutely essential to any peace that is
to be more than an armistice of fools.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The war has produced in the public opinion of the nations
a state of mind which formerly would not have been regarded
as possible in our age of internationalism and intellectuality.
National egotism and the effort to assert one&#8217;s own national
interests by all and every means are dominating so exclusively
each belligerent group that it forms for itself a closed
circle of ideas, and under its influence conclusions are drawn
which are so contradictory that one is almost inclined to
think that logic and common sense have been entirely
eliminated from the thinking capacity of the warring
nations....</p>

<p>We Germans, among the others, are subject to this war-suggestion.
We do not wish to say, after the manner of
the Pharisees, beating their breasts: &#8220;We thank Thee, Lord,
that we are not like these publicans.&#8221; We know that we,
too, are prisoners of our circle of ideas, and must remain so,
for we, too, are ruled by our national egotism and by our
desire to win the war.&mdash;<i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>, as quoted by the
<i>Daily News</i>, September 3, 1915.</p></div>

<p>Ideas imprisoned, narrowed (beschr&auml;nkt, as the
Germans say), become putrescent through lack of free
air. It is in this putrescence that the gospel of hate is
bred. Here is a German officer&#8217;s protest against the
infamy of this gospel. It is quoted from the
<i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i> by Mr. A.&nbsp;G. Gardiner in his book,
&#8220;The War Lords&#8221;:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Perhaps you will be so good as to assist, by the publication
of these lines, in freeing our troops from an evil which
they feel very strongly. I have on many occasions, when
distributing among the men the postal packets, observed
among them postcards on which the defeated French, English
and Russians were derided in a tasteless fashion. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>impression made by these postcards on our men is highly
noteworthy. Scarcely anybody is pleased with these postcards;
on the contrary, every one expresses his displeasure.</p>

<p>This is quite natural when one considers the position. We
know how victories are won. We also know by what tremendous
sacrifices they are obtained. We see with our own
eyes the unspeakable misery of the battlefield. We rejoice
over our victories, but our joy is damped by the recollection
of the sad pictures which we observe almost daily.</p>

<p>And our enemies have, in an overwhelming majority of
cases, truly not deserved to be derided in such a way. Had
they not fought bravely we should not have had to register
such losses.</p>

<p>Insipid, therefore, as these postcards are in themselves,
their effect here on the battlefields, in face of our dead and
wounded, is only calculated to cause disgust. Such postcards
are as much out of place on the battlefield as a clown
is at a funeral. Perhaps these lines may prove instrumental
in decreasing the number of such postcards sent to our
troops.</p></div>

<p>Personally, I believe this to express the soul of the
real Germany and the soul of the real England. The
soul of any people is the <i>best</i> that is in it.</p>

<p>The following is from a lecture delivered by Prof.
H. Gomperz in Vienna, early in 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, in our day all sorts of speakers and
writers feel called upon to preach to us the doctrine of hate,
in prose and even in verse, more especially against one of the
countries opposing us. I do them the honour of assuming
that even they do not mean that we are to translate this
feeling into action; rather, even they do not dream of doing
the slightest harm to any individual Englishman in so far as
it is not necessary or inevitable for the purposes of victory.
What then does this preaching of hatred mean, if indeed it
means anything at all, and is not the mere empty clamour of
some people anxious to attract attention without rendering
useful service? Do they mean us to nurse and cherish the
feeling of hate? Truly a strange demand after nearly two
thousand years of training in the teaching of the gospel!
And besides, whom are we to hate? The individual doing his
duty in the service of his country, just as we are? Or the
responsible governors of the destinies of that country, and the
irresponsible leaders of its public opinion?&#8221; Hatred of the
individual serving his country and governed by others Prof.
Gomperz does not stop to discuss. It can obviously be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>product only of what with etymological correctness we may
term <i>insanity</i>. The governors and leaders imagined an
irreconcilable antagonism. If they were right their case is
justified; if they are wrong we must no more hate them than
we should hate a patient suffering temporarily from delusion.&mdash;<i>International
Review</i>, August, 1915.</p></div>

<p>Magnus Schwantje spoke very plainly at a meeting
of the Schopenhauer Society at D&uuml;sseldorf in June,
1915. He allows that the state has a right to wage a
war of defence, but <i>not to force anyone to serve in the
army</i>. Schopenhauer, he tells us, &#8220;esteems sympathy
with all that lives and suffers more highly than love
for the Fatherland.... During a war a noble man
desires such an issue as may be most beneficial to the
whole world.... With all our readiness to recognise
the merit of patriotic self-denial, we, the admirers of
Schopenhauer, have to warn our compatriots, especially
during a war, of the danger of patriotism degenerating
into injustice, or even hatred and malicious joy at the
misfortune of other nations.... Not one of the
European peoples can be suppressed without heavy
loss to the whole world, and not one has the right to
force its special character on the others.&#8221; (<i>International
Review</i>, September, 1915.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">War Literature.</span></h3>

<p>It is the elderly gentlemen on both sides who exude
vitriol. It is a pity that they are so much in evidence.
But even some of them retain their sanity. The
following is from the <i>Cambridge Magazine</i> of May 15,
1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Those who, at the beginning of the war, were induced by
the Press to wonder whether any elderly German professor
had retained his mental equilibrium will now be disposed to
wonder whether the proportion of serious cases is after all
larger there than here. At any rate the Schopenhauer Society
is a very important learned body, and Prof. Deussen, of Kiel,
is one of the most distinguished of German scholars. And
this is how he writes in the fourth year book of the Schopenhauer
Society&mdash;apparently in terms of contempt for a loquacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>minority (the translation is taken from the April number
of the <i>Open Court</i>, and the italics are ours, especially the concluding
shot at the Lady Patriot):</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not to my contemporaries,&#8217; says Schopenhauer, &#8216;not to
my countrymen, but to humanity do I commit my work which
is now completed, in the confidence that it will not be
without value to the race. Science, and more than every
other science, philosophy is international.&#8217; ... Foolish,
very foolish, therefore is the conduct of <i>certain German professors</i>
who have renounced their foreign honours and titles.
And what shall we say of a member of our society who
demanded that citizens of those states which are at war with
us should be excluded from the Schopenhauer Society, and
who, when it was pointed out that our foreign members certainly
condemned this infamous war as much as we Germans,
protested that she could not belong to an association in which
Frenchmen, Englishmen and Russians took part, and
announced her withdrawal from our society, indeed, even
published her brave resolution in the columns of a local
paper in her provincial town. <i>We shall not shed any tears</i>
for her having gone.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></div>

<p>Romain Rolland bears out the idea that &#8220;in all
countries the extremest views have been expressed by
writers already past middle age.&#8221; So it is in
Germany, Rolland tells us. Dehmel, the enemy of
war, has enlisted at 51; Gerhart Hauptmann, &#8220;the
poet of brotherly love,&#8221; cries out for slaughter. But
Fritz von Unruh has, from the battlefield, written
&#8220;Das Lamm&#8221;: &#8220;Lamb of God, I have seen Thy look
of suffering; lead us back to the heaven of love.&#8221;
Rudolf Leonhard, who was caught up in the storm,
wrote afterwards on the front page of his poems:
&#8220;These were written during the madness of the first
weeks. That madness has spent itself, and only our
strength is left. We shall again win control over
ourselves and love one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>No &#8220;glory&#8221; of war is in these simple, poignant
words of Ludwig Marck&mdash;simply a dire evil that we
have not the sanity to avoid. &#8220;Whether you gaze
trembling into the eyes of the beloved, or mark down
your enemy with pitiless glance, think of the eye that
will grow dim, of the failing breath, the parched lips
and clenched hands, the final solitude, and the brow
that grows moist in the last pangs.... Be kind....
Tenderness is wisdom. Kindness is reason....
We are strangers all upon this earth, and die but to
be reunited.&#8221; Thus Franz Werfel. Since these words
cannot be called barbaric, they will perhaps be called
sentimental. It is true that to those of us who have
loved our comrades, of whatever nation, the sentiment
of brotherhood does just now make a somewhat tragic
appeal. If that appeal, in these days of decimated
ideals, be at times strained and feverish, it scarcely
lies in the mouths of the apostles of hate to deride
us. The sentimentality of hatred is uglier and more
fatuous than the sentimentality of brotherhood.</p>

<p>Hermann Hesse is living at Berne. He has
implored the writers of all nations not to join with
their pens in destroying the future of Europe. From
a poem of later date come these words: &#8220;All possessed
it, but no one prized it. Like a cool spring it has
refreshed us all. What a sound the word peace has
for us now. Distant it sounds, and fearful, and heavy
with tears. No one knows or can name the day for
which all sigh with such longing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not let us forget that almost everything that is most
militarist is <i>old</i>. It is only the old who affect still to
glory in war&mdash;the old newspapers, the old reviews, the
old statesmen, and some, perhaps, of the old soldiers&mdash;it
is to what is newest, youngest, most creative,
most living that we look not in vain for an unshaken
belief in brotherhood, for a clear acknowledgment that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>any other belief would throw us back into the ape and
tiger struggle of world beginnings, but with the ape
ten thousand times more cunning and the tiger ten
thousand times more cruel. To some German
publications the war is a stupid eruption of barbarism
into a workshop where work was being done. <i>Die
Aktion</i> scoffs mercilessly at the Chauvinists and at
Lissauer with his Hymn of Hate.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Even Lissauer,
be it remarked, has published his repentance, and, personally,
I respect him for it. The man who can say that
he spoke too strongly is always worth knowing. The
man who insists elaborately on his consistency (as the
politicians do) is usually singularly devoid of any
appreciation of truth. <i>Die Aktion</i> (1915) goes on
steadily with its appreciation of French artists, as if
no war were in progress. There may be some
affectation in this attitude, but it is to be preferred,
I think, to the complete ostracism of work of the
enemy called for by a noisy but, I believe, small
section on this side. <i>Die Weissen Bl&auml;tter</i> appeared
in January, 1915, with the following announcement:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>It seems good to us to begin the work of reconstruction
in the midst of the war. The community of Europe is at
present apparently destroyed. Is it not the duty of all of
us who are not bearing arms to live from to-day onwards
according to the dictates of our conscience, as it will be the
duty of every German when once the war is over?</p></div>

<p>Evidently the editor has in his mind a contrast
between the dictates of conscience and the dictates of
officialism. He was born in Alsace, so he may well
know this contrast. We are learning it here. In the
February number the <i>Krieg mit dem Maul</i> (war with
the mouth) was most vigorously condemned:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>If journalists hope to inspire courage by insulting the
enemy, they are mistaken&mdash;we refuse such stimulants. We
dare to maintain our opinion that the humblest volunteer of
the enemy, who, from an unreasoned but exalted sentiment of
patriotism, fires upon us from an ambush, knowing well what
he risks, is much superior to those journalists who profit by
the public feeling of the day, and under cover of high-sounding
words of patriotism do not fight the enemy, but spit on
him.</p></div>

<p>I am reminded of words used by one of my Swiss
friends: &#8220;As soon as soldiers must get their fighting
force from suggestions of puerile besmirching of the
enemy, then war indeed becomes intolerably base.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette Kolb, daughter of a German father and a
French mother, had the courage to proclaim openly
in a public lecture at Dresden that <i>she was faithful
to both sides</i>, and to express her regret that Germany
should fail to understand France. After all, German
intolerance must have its limits for such a bold speech
to be possible.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Herzog in the Munich <i>Forum</i> has attacked
the intellectual fire-eaters, the patriots who insult
other peoples and the Chauvinists generally. He
defends France, the French army and French civilisation,
against the brilliant novelist, Thomas Mann.
Above all does he condemn the intellectual babble:
&#8220;The wrong that these privy councillors and professors
have done us with their &#8216;Aufkl&auml;rungsarbeit&#8217;
can hardly be measured. They have isolated themselves
from humanity by their inability to realise the
feelings of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lowes Dickinson has called attention in the
<i>Hibbert</i> of October, 1915, to a pamphlet by Dr.
Friedrich Wilhelm F&ouml;rster, entitled &#8220;Deutschlands
Jugend und der Weltkrieg.&#8221; The same pamphlet is
quoted in <i>The Ethical Movement</i> of the same date.
Here are some extracts:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;Hate disorganises, love disciplines. Fill yourselves with
deepest sympathy for all who suffer in war, whose hearts are
crushed, whose bodies are broken, whose homes are burned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>... and win a peace which shall make the recurrence of
such things for ever impossible. Such a purification from the
passion of hate is often easier on the field than at home.
Those who remain behind have an abstract enemy in view.
The soldier sees living men who suffer and die like himself.&#8221;
It will startle the English reader to find Dr. F&ouml;rster pleading
earnestly that the English soldier is not responsible for the
ways of his government or of his leaders. The Germans are
to remain true to themselves whatever the others may do.
Each side, observe, accuses the other of barbarous methods,
and impartiality is impossible. The most that one can expect
of the ardent partisan is perhaps that he should, like Dr.
F&ouml;rster, urge those on his side to remain true to their ideals,
whatever the enemy may do. &#8220;England has given us also
the Salvation Army, and invaluable higher points of view
for the treatment of Labour questions and social work. She
has taught our revolutionary spirits and moderated our party
passions. Let us always remember this, and in that
remembrance grasp again in the future the proffered hand.&#8221;
For Dr. F&ouml;rster it is for this better England that Germany
now fights, just as for many an Englishman it is for the
better Germany that England is fighting. &#8220;And it is better
for us to fight for that better England than to rage
and spit upon ... Grey and his followers. In sleepless
nights kindle the eternal light of Christ in your souls and
try to love your enemies. Think of that great William Booth
and of all the English greatness and goodness embodied in
him; of Florence Nightingale, the heroine and saint, whose
pioneer work is still binding up to-day unnumbered wounds;
and think of Carlyle, Ruskin, and Toynbee and of those
mighty forces of conscience which spoke in their words and
gave to us Germans, and will give us yet, so much that is
great.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;Christ stands against war and above war. He who
loses sight of this truth slays that deep conscience of civilisation
which is meant to goad us unceasingly on to allay this
fury of war. We know well that if we were Christians there
would be no war.&#8221; F&ouml;rster denounces the bawling haters
&#8220;who must open their mouths 42 centimetres wide,&#8221; and
think that he who does not do it is no patriot.</p>

<p>&#8220;To conquer and silence them must be your first task,
young men of the new Germany; you who have been purified
by sacrifice and suffering. For what would it profit our
people if it gained the whole world and lost its own soul?&#8221;
May we not, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, take this appeal to heart ourselves?</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;The essence and foundation of the State is precisely the
opposite of power, viz., law, treaty, fellowship between opposed
interests, and the whole outer strength of a State rests upon
the depth and firmness of these, its inner conditions and
links. Therefore the first commandment of life for the
State is not to create for itself might but to care for the
ethical unity of its members, for the supremacy of the conscience
and the sense of law above rude self-interest.&#8221;&mdash;(Quoted
in the <i>Ethical Movement</i>, October, 1915.)</p></div>

<p>Granted that voices such as those of Herzog,
F&ouml;rster, Sch&uuml;cking, Schwantje are a minority, it is
yet plain that they represent more than themselves.
The existence of such reviews and utterances implies
the existence of at least many thousands who have not
been deluded by their governors. Of those who have
been deluded into enmity, but who have never
dreamed of world dominance, there are, I am
convinced, many millions. Bernhardi was introduced
to Germany by England. There were four million
Social Democrats. They have defended their country,
but they have never dreamed of aggression. The time
will come to claim the help of these men and the many
others of the wiser Germany. That wiser Germany
will yet live to be, not an army of destruction, but an
army of progress.</p>

<p>Henrietta Thomas, of Baltimore, Maryland, went
early in 1915 with a message of fellowship from
English people to German people. There was some
surprise, some tendency to view the message as
Utopian, but always a cordial acknowledgment and a
real goodwill. Dr. Siegmund Schulze was most
heartily in sympathy. &#8220;He feels that the ultimate
hope of peace lies in the increasing use of arbitration.&#8221;
&#8220;One very sweet-spirited elderly gentleman in Berlin
said that when he prayed things looked different&mdash;he
seemed to see things through God&#8217;s eyes&mdash;but as a
man he had to fight.&#8221; &#8220;At Stuttgart and Frankfurt
I found the peace people more thoroughgoing in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>sentiments.&#8221; The secretary of the Stuttgart Peace
Society said: &#8220;The armed peace of Europe is an
exploded idea. As long as we have armies we shall
use them. We must educate the people to realise this,
and to work for disarmament.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Lichtstrahlen</i> was originally founded as an independent
monthly periodical by a Socialist, Julian
Borchardt. The periodical was unofficial and had a
difficult struggle for existence. This was before the
war. When the war broke out the editor took as
strong a line against it as the censor allowed. The
circulation rose so much that Borchardt was able to
convert the monthly into a weekly. Rosa Luxembourg
and Frank Mehring, greatly daring, started the
<i>Internationale</i> with the object of rebuilding the International
Labour and Socialist movement during the
war. The review was instantly suppressed, but
was reprinted afterwards at Berne. Among the
contributors is the well-known Clara Zetkin. She
refers enthusiastically to the Christmas message sent
by British women to the women of Germany and
other belligerent countries. (<i>Labour Leader</i>, June 17,
1915.) Marie Engelmann, of Dresden, has protested
with equal strength.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">From an American Lady.</span></h3>

<p>The following is an extract from a valuable letter by
Madeline G. Doty, an American, which appeared in
the <i>Nation</i> of June 12, 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>My most revolutionary talk was with a gray-haired
mother of grown children, in a secluded corner of a quiet
restaurant. A burning flame this woman. Her face stamped
with world suffering, her eyes the tragic eyes of a Jane
Addams. In a whisper she uttered the great heresy:
&#8216;German salvation lies in Germany&#8217;s defeat. If Germany
wins when so many of her progressive young men have been
slain, the people will be utterly crushed in the grip of the
mailed fist.&#8217;</p>

<p>With this companion I discussed the collapse of the
Social Democrats in the hour of crisis, the triumph of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>nationalism over internationalism. She attributes it to
military training. During the period of service a man
becomes a thing. Automatically, he acquires habits of
obedience, is reduced to an unquestioning machine.
Mechanically, when the call came, the Social Democrats,
with the others, fell into line. But with time
has come thought. Also knowledge&mdash;knowledge that, in the
first instance, Germany&#8217;s war was not one of self-defence.
But it is too late to rebel. Most of the Social Democrats
are at the front. From month to month they have put off
protest as unwise. Only Liebknecht has made himself
heard. Now he has been caught up in the iron hand, and
sent to battle. But women are not bound by the spell of
militarism. While the Government rejoiced at the submission
of its Socialist men, the women grew active.
Organising a party of their own, they fought bravely. Last
fall Rosa Luxembourg dashed into the street and addressed
a regiment of soldiers. &#8216;Don&#8217;t go to war, don&#8217;t shoot your
brothers,&#8217; she cried. For this offence she was sent to prison
for a year. To-day she lies in solitary confinement. But
her suffering only inspires the others. In March 750 women
walked to the Reichstag. At the entrance they halted. As
the members entered they shouted, &#8216;We will have no more
war; we will have peace.&#8217; Quickly the police dispersed them,
and the order went forth that no newspaper should print one
word of the protest. Still the women work on. On April 8,
an International Socialist Woman&#8217;s Congress was held at
Berne, Switzerland. Ten nations were represented, including
all the belligerents.</p>

<p>The task of peace propaganda in Germany is gigantic.
Neither by letter nor by Press can news be spread. Both
are censored. The work must be carried on by spoken word
passed from mouth to mouth. The courage of the little
band of women I had met was stupendous. Through them
I learned to love Germany. So my life in Berlin became a
double one. I ate and slept, and was unregenerate in one
part of the town, and only really lived when I escaped from
respectability and, strange contradiction of terms, became a
criminal fighting for peace.</p>

<p>But wherever I was, one fact grew omnipresent. Germany
was magnificently organised. Here lay the country&#8217;s
power and her weakness. Her power because it made Germany
a unit. There were no weak links in the chain. Her
weakness, because it robbed her people of individuality,
made them cogs in a machine.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Germany no longer cares whom she hurts,&#8221; runs
another passage in this letter; &#8220;like an unloved child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>at bay she means, to smash and kill. The pity of it!
Never was there a more generous, soft-hearted, kindly
people. Germany, the land of the Christmas tree and
folk songs, and hearthsides and gay childish laughter,
turned into a relentless fighting machine! But each
individual is a cog firmly fixed in the machine, which
will go ever on as long as the ruling power turns the
crank.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Two Soldiers&#8217; Letters.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;If I were not firmly convinced that even this war
will help to establish the Kingdom of God I could
hardly endure it. But I believe that after passing
through this hell humanity will come to itself and
learn to believe in the reign of human brotherhood....
I cannot tell you the moral suffering I go
through. These butcheries are utter madness. I
cannot forget for a moment that our enemies are men,
and consequently our brothers.&#8221; So wrote a young
German soldier student quoted by Mr. Jerome K.
Jerome.</p>

<p>The following letter is from the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>.
A soldier&#8217;s young sister had written asking him to
&#8220;kill a lot of Russians&#8221; and &#8220;to gain a new victory
in order to cheer us up.&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;Kill a lot of Russians.&#8217;
You have not seen them lying about&mdash;those poor dead,
with their singularly solemn faces.... You have not
seen the battle which preceded, and the bad wounds
which so many of my friends got in trying to kill a lot
of them. You do not think of the fact that those dead
men had parents, brothers, and sisters whom they
loved. And you have not seen the harrowing
destruction of the villages and towns&mdash;how the poor,
hunted-down population is running away, leaving
everything they had behind them to be consumed by
the flames.... And then, remember, we are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>fighting in order to cheer you up&mdash;we are not lying
about in the open-air day and night, starved and
suffering from wounds and homesickness, in order
that you at home may be cheerful at the tea or beer
table. We are fighting and bearing this terrible
wretchedness in order that you may he spared the
horrors of war, and that Germany&#8217;s future may be
bright.&#8221; That is, I believe, what the enormous
majority of Germany&#8217;s soldiers are fighting for.
Soldiers on both sides have similar and quite reconcilable
aims; but government is too complex to express
the simple will of the people. In every country, it
seems to me, anti-militarist opinion only needs its
chance. I was struck by the frequency with which
such an opinion cropped up when I was travelling a
few weeks in Germany not long before the war. On
the top of the Belchen I encountered it in talking to a
native of W&uuml;rtemberg. Again in a walk with a young
German to the Feldberg; again in a book-shop
at Freiburg; again in chance railway talk with
a very well-educated German on my way to
Berlin. In Berlin itself a giant Westphalian accosted
me, as he wanted to make the acquaintance of &#8220;one
of these terrible fellows who mean to smash up
Germany.&#8221; His political ideal consisted in the belief
that England and Germany, understanding each
other, could keep the peace of the world.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Albert Klein.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Albert Klein, of Giessen, who was killed in the
Champagne in February, felt compelled to side with
his Government, as so many do in times of crisis. To
that extent his was a biased judgment. It is a bias
that one has seen possessing almost everywhere the
noblest souls. But Klein could write thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>When I read all this inflated stuff in the papers&mdash;written
by men guiltily conscious of being very safe in their offices at
home&mdash;to the effect that every soldier is a hero, I feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>positively disgusted. Heroism is far too rare to form a basis
for a national army. What is needed to make and keep that
a coherent whole is that men must respect their leaders and
fear them more than the enemy, and that leaders must be
conscientious, true to their duty, well informed, resourceful
and self-controlled. Thank God, there is plenty of the good
old discipline yet. But these fine fellows come along, concoct
a mess of New Year reflections and Centenary speeches and
boldly declaim about the German spirit that is to heal mankind.
They pick up all the filth of the foreign Press and fling
it back with threefold interest. It is just because I am so
passionately devoted to all that the noblest Germans have
done for the civilisation of the world that I do not desire to
see us burdened with a task we cannot accomplish.</p>

<p>If Germany&#8217;s contribution to the world&#8217;s civilisation is the
highest we can strive for, we must seek afresh to live in
peace and concord with the other nations. Then we shall
cease calling every Englishman a hypocrite and every Frenchman
empty-headed, quite apart from the daily proofs we get
of their military ability. Oh, my dear friends, believe me,
the man on the spot who sees and experiences all this, does
not talk so complacently of death and sacrifice and victory, as
those who, far from the front, ring the bells, make fine
speeches and write the papers. He resigns himself to the
bitter necessity of suffering and death when the hour comes,
and he knows and sees how many, too many sacrifices have
already been made, knows it is time, high time that all this
devastation ceased, not only on our side, but on the other side,
too.</p>

<p>It is just in seeing all this suffering that we feel a new bond
of sympathy (and you, my dear ones, would feel just the same,
yes, I know, you feel it already) uniting us with the enemy.</p>

<p>If, as I hardly dare to hope, I return from this murderous
war, it will be one of my most welcome duties to steep my
mind in the culture of those that now oppose us. I mean to
build up on a broader basis the aim and purpose of my life,
namely, historical and philosophical meditation on culture in
its highest form.</p>

<p>Last night I was strangely moved, having an opportunity of
seeing a convoy of prisoners and speaking to one of them, a
colleague, a classical philologist from Vigeac. Such a frank,
intelligent man, with an excellent military training, as indeed
were all the company with him! He told me how terrible
it had been to endure the firing of our machine-guns
(d&eacute;moralisant, he called it)&mdash;and showed me
clearly the utter senselessness of war. How we should like to
be friends with people so like us in education, habits of life,
thought and interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>We soon got into conversation about a book on Rousseau
and began a regular argument, like two old philologists. He
saw the ribbon in my button-hole and when he heard it was
the Iron Cross he said: &#8220;F&eacute;licitations!&#8221; His sparkling
interest in the striped ribbon seemed to me so characteristic
of a Southern Frenchman and very touching.</p>

<p>How alike we are in worth and merit! How untrue all
these tales told by our papers of the French being broken and
spent! Just as untrue as all that the <i>Temps</i> writes about us.
And all he said, this French colleague of mine, betrayed so
much independent thought and respect for German mind and
character. Why should we, fated to be friends, always be
divided? I was deeply troubled, and sat there for a long time
lost in thought, but all my brooding brought me no solution.</p>

<p>And the end not in sight yet, the end of this war, that for
six months has been gorging itself with human life and prosperity
and happiness! The same feeling amongst us and
amongst them! Always the same picture! We are so much
alike, we achieve the same, we suffer the same, just because
we happen to be such bitter enemies.&mdash;(From the <i>International
Review</i>.)</p></div>

<p>The following is another extract given by M. Romain
Rolland. It is taken from the letter of a German
soldier to a Swiss professor:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The longing for peace is intense with us. At least with
all those who are at the front, forced to kill and to be killed.
The newspapers say that it is not possible to stem the war-like
passion of the soldiers. They lie, knowingly or unknowingly.
Our pastors deny that this passion is abating. You
cannot think how indignant we are at such nonsense. Let
them hold their tongues and not speak of things they do not
understand. Or, rather, let them come here, not as chaplains
in the rear, but in the line of fire, with arms in their hands.
Perhaps then they will perceive the inner change which is
going on in thousands of us. In the eyes of these parsons a man
who has no passion for war is unworthy of his age. But it
seems to me that we who are faithfully doing our duty without
enthusiasm for the war, and hating it from the bottom of
our souls, are finer heroes than the others. They speak of
a Holy War. I know of no Holy War. I only know one
war, and that is the sum of everything that is inhuman,
impious, and beastly in man, a visitation of God and a call
to repentance to the people who rushed into it, or allowed
themselves to be drawn into it. God has plunged men into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>this Hell in order to teach them to love Heaven. As for the
German people, the war seems to be a chastisement and a call
to contrition&mdash;addressed first of all to our German Church.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Germany in Peace Time.</span></h3>

<p>Enough has been cited to give a glimpse of the better
Germany in the time of this war. Let us remember,
too, what she has been in peace. &#8220;After all, in our
saner moments we all of us know that the Germans
are a great people, with a great part in the world to
play. Their boasts about their &#8216;culture&#8217; are not idle
boasts, and, when one comes to think of it, it is rather
important to have in our midst a people that <i>cares</i> to
boast about its culture. The Englishman is more
given to complaining than boasting, and when he does
boast it is certainly not about culture. As it seems
to me, the Germans excel in two things&mdash;simple
tenderness of sentiment and the work of patient
observation. I am aware that it has for a considerable
time been the mode in England to slight German
literature. Personally, I consider this one of those
temporary poses to which superior persons are liable.
Leave out all the great names if you will&mdash;Goethe,
Schiller, Heine, and the rest&mdash;and we still have the
folk-songs. A nation that can produce those folk-songs
has got unusual gifts for the world. And, of
course, we envy the Germans their music. Of all the
contemptible utterances that this war has produced
(and it has produced a good many) none has been worse
than the silly blathering against German music just
because it is German. What have Beethoven, Bach,
Schubert, Schumann, Wagner got to do with the
politics of the present war? Leaving the arts aside,
it is quite certain that in any region where careful
observation and painstaking thought are required, no
one can afford to neglect Germany. Recently I was
looking through May&#8217;s &#8216;Guide to the Roman Pottery
in the York Museum.&#8217; Among the names of those
dealing with the subject of Roman pottery I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>the best known are those of D&eacute;chelette and Dragendorff&mdash;the
one French, the other German. Among the
other references I found fourteen to German publications
and four to English, one of the latter being
merely a museum catalogue. No one can study
philosophy without continual reference to German
thought. Even in a subject so English as the study
of Shakespeare the work of Gervinus is fundamental,
and from the time of Lessing to that of Ten Brink
there has been a succession of German commentators.
Those of us who have worked at all at science know
only too well what we owe to Germany there. It has,
indeed, been at times painful to compare the mass of
the German output with the comparatively thin stream
of English work. Of course, there has been splendid
English research, but as a people we are not lovers of
knowledge, and we are specially loath to apply it.
Again and again our scientific papers have been filled
with diatribes against our English neglect of science,
and the diatribes were needed. I remember asking a
British firm of repute to construct for me a resistance
&#8216;bridge&#8217; of a simple kind. I explained the whole
purpose of the apparatus, but when it came back to
me the resistance wire was soldered down in two
places to broad bands of brass. This, of course, altered
the resistance and rendered the apparatus useless.
A rudimentary knowledge of electricity would have
made such a mistake impossible. Contrast this with
the following: When I was a student a lecturer
wished to prepare a rather rare compound for some
work of his. We both tried for long to prepare a
specimen, but failed, probably because the
temperature of our furnace was not high enough. We
then sent to a German firm of manufacturing
chemists, and they prepared it for us at once. I
remarked recently to an English scientific chemist,
&#8216;No English firm would have done that.&#8217; &#8216;Well, if
you had pressed them,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;they would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>sent over to &mdash;&mdash; (a German firm) and then put their
own label on the bottle.&#8217; A &#8216;chemist&#8217; in too many
of our works has too often been a lad who has picked
up some routine knowledge, but who has no more
scientific equipment than a farm labourer. Contrast
this with the state of things at the <i>Badische Anilin
und Soda Fabrik</i>, where as many as <i>sixty</i> trained
chemists are employed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often thought of these things when I have
heard manufacturers bewailing German competition.
The war has produced many strange intellectual
somersaults, and it is curious to notice how many
Free Traders are now eager for the destruction, not
temporarily, but permanently, of German trade. A
few months ago they would have preached in season
and out on the advantage to England of receiving
cheap goods, they would have extolled German
scientific methods, and they would (with every right)
have pointed out that a customer who buys forty
million pounds&#8217; worth of our goods is scarcely one
whom we should wish to destroy. All these facts
remain absolutely unaltered by the war. All that has
happened is that a half-ashamed jealousy is no longer
ashamed, and is masquerading as patriotism so
successful as to have misled the majority of our
countrymen&mdash;for a time. The day of reckoning will
come, and we shall not then find it any better than
previously to buy dear goods to please the manufacturers.
Moreover, our men of business will not
have learned scientific methods by the end of the war.
A publisher&#8217;s circular that I recently received appealed,
on patriotic grounds, for the purchase of a book on
applied science. I am not very cynical, but I confess
that I distrust these trade appeals to patriotism. The
true patriot does not advertise his patriotism in order
to make money. In this case the work was well known
and important, but it was interesting to observe that
almost every one of the contributors was German, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>that the rest were German-Swiss. Surely, in spite of
its horror, there are many things in this contest to
make the gods laugh.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">British Recognition.</span></h3>

<p>It is pleasant to find recognition of Germany&#8217;s
commercial deserts among British commercial men.
The annual conference of the United Kingdom Commercial
Travellers&#8217; Association was opened at the
Town Hall, Manchester, on May 24, 1915. Sir
William Mather, who was unanimously elected
president, referred to Germany as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The position of Germany in the world of commerce had
been attained as the result of years of patient and persistent
organisation, of close application to business, of exhaustive
and careful research work, and full appreciation of the requirements
and necessities of the markets for which she was catering,
and a determination to meet those requirements in strict
accordance with the wishes and needs of her potential customers.
Behind all the efforts had been lavish financial
support by the German Government, and the pledging of
national credit for individual and private enterprise.</p>

<p>The position secured by Germany as a result of her persistent
application of these methods was not to be seriously
challenged, nor would she be deprived of her hold upon it by
anything other than the use by Englishmen of the same
skill, the same elasticity, the same persistence, and the same
efficiency in every branch of commerce.</p>

<p>Commercial travellers, as one of the most important parts
of the mechanism, must, if the desired result be obtained, make
themselves fully efficient for their part in the work. They
had been perhaps, as vocal as any section of the community
as to the necessity and possibility of extending English trade,
but it was much to be regretted that when opportunities were
given and facilities provided, more particularly for the
younger men to equip themselves for the work which had to
be done in extending British commerce abroad, the response
was extremely inadequate.&mdash;(<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, May 25, 1915.)</p></div>

<p>As regards chemical research there also fortunately
remain those who still ungrudgingly admit our
enormous indebtedness to Germany. In March, 1915,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>Professor Percy Frankland, F.R.S., addressed the
Birmingham Section of the Society of Chemical
Industry on &#8220;The Chemical Industries of Germany.&#8221;
With true and chivalrous courtesy, Professor Frankland,
in a footnote to his printed address, writes:
&#8220;The author has much pleasure in acknowledging the
assistance he has received from the valuable compilation
by Professor Lepsius of Berlin, &#8216;Deutschlands
Chem. Industrie, 1888-1913,&#8217; and from that by Dr.
Duisberg, of Elberfeld, &#8216;Wissenschaft und Technik,&#8217;
1911.&#8221; I believe such courtesy is more characteristically
British than the lack of it sometimes shown by
others. The following quotations from Professor
Frankland&#8217;s address are of interest:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Industries Dependent on Synthetic Organic
Chemistry.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquote"><p>... During the major part of the [past] 60 years the
great bulk of the discoveries in this domain have been made
in Germany. Organic chemistry is, perhaps, the branch of
science which more perfectly suits the German mind and
temperament. It involves the possession of those qualities in
which Germans are so pre-eminent&mdash;the capacity for taking
an infinitude of pains, the capacity to anticipate difficulties
and organise means to circumvent them.... It is in the
possession of such schools of research, both in the universities
and in the chemical factories, that Germany has by two
generations the lead of all other countries in the world....
The chemical manufacturers in this country have, with some
notable exceptions, failed to establish anything worthy of the
name of research laboratories in connection with their works....
Whereas the artificial colour industry started in
England, that of artificial drugs is entirely of German origin,
and may be said to begin with the discovery by Liebig of
chloroform in 1831, and of chloral hydrate in 1832.... The
composition of the personnel who carry on these German colour
works is at the bottom of their success. Take the works of
Messrs. Meister, Lucius, und Br&uuml;ning as an example. In
1913, the composition was as follows: Workmen, 7,680;
managers, 374; expert chemists, 307; technologists, 74;
commercial staff, 611. Contrast with the above the fact that
the six English factories now producing dyestuffs employ
altogether only 35 chemists, whilst evidence of their relative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>activities is again furnished by the circumstance that between
1886 and 1900 the English firms took out only 86 patents,
whereas the six principal German firms were responsible for
948 during the same period. Having shown that these German
coal-tar colour manufacturers are without rivals from the
commercial point of view, I feel it to be my duty to point out
also that their industry is carried on under conditions of
labour which are highly creditable to the management.</p></div>

<p>Professor Frankland goes on to urge that we should
at least pay heed to &#8220;the warnings repeated <i>ad
nauseam</i> by the chemical profession during a whole
generation.&#8221; Those warnings told us of the stupidity
and peril of neglecting science. It is not mere
commercialism but science that is needed. The help
of science, it may be added, will never be gained
unless devotion is paid to it for its own sake, and not
simply as a means to money. That reward is too far
off for mere commercialism. Adolf Baeyer synthesised
indigo in 1880, but it cost 17 years of laborious
investigation and the investment of nearly &pound;1,000,000
of capital before that synthesis could be made a
commercial success. So long a chase is not carried out
by those who are thinking only of the prize. The hunt
itself must interest them. That, I personally fear, is
where we in Britain (and especially in England) are
somewhat lacking.</p>

<p>Two other points in Professor Frankland&#8217;s address I
would draw attention to. In emphasising the need of
scientific men on the directorates he asks: &#8220;What
does not the firm of Messrs. Brunner, Mond and Co.,
for example, owe to the late Dr. Ludwig Mond,
F.R.S.?&#8221; Just so. Dr. Ludwig Mond was a German.
He came to this country and brought with him his
energy, enterprise, and his very exceptional scientific
endowments. With Mr. J.&nbsp;J. Brunner he was thus
able to found what became the largest alkali works in
the kingdom, and undoubtedly one of the most
scientific and enterprising works we have. Incidentally
it is worth mentioning that the firm of Brunner, Mond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>and Co. was one of the first to introduce the eight
hours day. There are people about (a few of whom
ought to know better) asking for the exclusion of the
German in the future. I would venture to suggest
that we might well exchange very many English
people of such limited brain capacity for one Ludwig
Mond. To shut the door to men is to shut the doors
to talent, and talent produces its best by cross-fertilisation.</p>

<p>I may at this point insert an illustration communicated
to me privately. My informant said: &#8220;When
I was a very young man I determined to try to save
a business which was falling in ruin. My project was
strongly opposed by my friends, but I determined to
carry it out. The works which I took over were then
employing 150 men. There was a great lack of
scientific training, and <i>this</i> I saw was the chief cause
of disaster. So I began sending my men to Germany
to be trained. The Germans have always, at their
State-supported universities, welcomed the foreigner
and given him their best knowledge. My men brought
that knowledge back to England. The result was that
by the time I withdrew from active work we were
employing about three thousand men. The Germans
had thus given work to nearly three thousand Englishmen.
People should remember facts of this kind when
they talk of Germans coming here and &#8216;taking the
bread out of our mouths.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The wife of an interned man struggled to keep his
business. She was, however, ruined. &#8220;Serve you
right,&#8221; she was told, &#8220;coming here and taking the
bread out of our people&#8217;s mouths.&#8221; What a strange
idea of humanity! What are &#8220;our people&#8221;? If a
Scotsman settles in London is he &#8220;taking the bread
out of our people&#8217;s mouths&#8217;&#8221;? We forget that the
foreigner is very often an enormous accession to a
State. The Norman conquerors who organised us, the
Flemings who improved our weaving, the Huguenots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>who gave new ideas to our commerce, the Germans
who brought us scientific method have all been
amongst the makers of England. Exclusiveness is a
constricting cord that strangles progress. Exchange of
commodities is, we know, the life of trade, and
exchange of men and ideas is the life of more than
trade.</p>

<p>The last quotation I shall make from Professor
Frankland&#8217;s address has, I venture to think, very
considerable bearing on the possibilities of future
friendship:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Notwithstanding the absence of material inducements, I
venture to say without fear of contradiction that there is
more original investigation being prosecuted in this country
by chemists than by any other body of British men of
science, and this I attribute to the fact that such a large
proportion of our number have either been at German
universities or are the pupils of those who have been at these
centres of research. Nor are any of us, I am sure, even
during this unfortunate crisis, unmindful of the hospitality
and inspiration which we have received in the schools of the
enemy.</p></div>

<p>One has met with so much pettiness and folly
masquerading as patriotism that it is delightful to
welcome such a truly noble utterance.</p>

<p>The allusion to the conditions of labour in Professor
Frankland&#8217;s address is also important. Most of us
regard the German labourer as far too controlled and
regulated, but everyone knows that Germany was to
the fore in care for the health and well-being of the
workman: &#8220;As to the factory legislation in general,
not only do they afford to children and juveniles a
greater measure of protection in regard to hours and
other conditions of work than is enforced by the
English Factory Acts, but many of their provisions
for ensuring the health, comfort, and safety of all
workers go beyond the limits which are thought
sufficient in this country.&#8221; (W.&nbsp;H. Dawson, &#8220;The
Evolution of Modern Germany,&#8221; p.&nbsp;332.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>Insurance against sickness and old age were
measures that we learned from Germany. They were
intended to increase British efficiency and well-being,
and our statesmen received every courtesy and help in
studying German methods. It will be said by many
that we shall not study those methods again. Perhaps
not. They may prefer an English method as
propounded by Lord Headley when speaking at a
luncheon in connection with the Bakery and Confectionery
Trades Exhibition held at Islington. The
report is from the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> as reproduced in the
<i>Labour Leader</i> (October 21, 1915):</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>In regard to many industries, the plain fact was that the
foreigner lived much more cheaply than the British workman
and charged far less for his labour. Where labour, and not
machinery, formed a small part of the cost of production we
should be able to compete with the foreigner, and that should
be the case in high class confectionery more than in anything
else. If we were to defeat the foreigner in other industries
after the war, it seemed to him that the British workman
would have to consent to work for lower wages than hitherto.
At any rate, he hoped so, in order that the country might
supply itself with necessities without having to go abroad for
them.</p></div>

<p>It seems to me that in this way we should &#8220;defeat&#8221;
not only the foreigner, but the Englishman as well&mdash;except
the privileged few who could get workmen at
low wages without lowering their profits. I remember
saying to a Colonial lady that we had gained much
from the science of German settlers in this country.
&#8220;Damn German science,&#8221; was her reply. A certain
type of employer desires two protections&mdash;protection
against the knowledge of the foreigner, and protection
against the aspirations of the worker. Both the knowledge
and the aspirations of others are a disturbance
of repose.</p>

<p>At a Nottingham meeting of the Society of Chemical
Industry the unscientific character of British methods
was again emphasised. So, too, at the Edinburgh
meeting in December, 1914.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>Principal A.&nbsp;P. Laurie, speaking of paints and
colours, said: &#8220;There were very few cases among
those he had inquired into of a chemical, a colour
product, or a pigment which was being made both in
Germany and in England in which the German product
was not better than that made in this country....
Again, it was admitted that German barytes was
better ground than English. Yet an extensive literature
on barytes and barytes mining had been published
by the Germans, showing exactly how German barytes
was ground. They had not found a barytes miner in
England who owned a microscope.... The English
manufacturer did not believe in or use the man of
science.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Tatlock, speaking from the laboratory glass
apparatus makers&#8217; point of view, said that British
manufacturers were finding it exceedingly difficult to
replace German and Austrian products....
Professor Henderson had referred to the possibility of
people buying more readily goods of British manufacture.
They did not find that to be the case. The
goods had to be cheaper or better; they would certainly
never be bought purely because they were British,
and he did not altogether think that they should be
bought for that reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is surely clear that the only wise world policy is
one in which each nation brings its own particular
contribution to the common stock and in no way tries
to shut others out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Policy of Boycotting Thought.</span></h3>

<p>We find it impossible to shut out German music.
&#8220;Germany, it must be said to its credit,&#8221; I read in
the daily Press, &#8220;is not boycotting foreign art.&#8221; In
the autumn of 1915 the Royal Theatres of Berlin
announced Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;Macbeth,&#8221; and &#8220;Antony
and Cleopatra,&#8221; and Scribe&#8217;s &#8220;Glass of Water.&#8221;
&#8220;Shakespeare, one hears,&#8221; writes a reviewer in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span><i>Daily News</i>, of December 4, 1915, &#8220;is still being
played in the German theatres. If you go to a theatre
in London you are more likely to see a performance
with a title like &#8216;I <i>don&#8217;t</i> Think!&#8217; or &#8216;Pass the
Mustard, Please!&#8217; Shakespeare, to tell the truth, is
in England left largely to professors and schoolboys.&#8221;</p>

<p>A silly crusade was started in this country against
German thought in general, a crusade so petty that it
made some of us wince for shame. The upholders of
creeds joined in hastily, for German investigators had
given our beliefs many uncomfortable shocks. We
remember how it came about that the President of
the Training College in Mark Rutherford&#8217;s Autobiography
could with such satisfaction to himself destroy
the &#8220;infidel.&#8221; &#8220;The President&#8217;s task was all the
easier because he knew nothing of German literature;
and, indeed, the word &#8216;German&#8217; was a term of
reproach signifying something very awful, although
nobody knew exactly what it was.&#8221; The obscurantist
and opponent of free thought has shown signs of hope
that the German&#8217;s reputation for awfulness may turn
us from his evil companionship into the restful paths
of British piety. The Englishman (especially, I
believe, the Saxon element) has too often been prone
to make a stronghold of ignorance. This stronghold
has certainly in industry proved to be a house of cards,
and I think it has proved to be equally a house of
cards in religion. It would, indeed, be a disastrous
outcome of the war if it led us still more to emphasise
our insularity. Unless we are readier after the war to
learn from everyone, we shall, as a nation, be mentally
moribund. It matters not in the least whether the
thought be German, French, Austrian, Swiss, Russian,
or any other. Miss Petre, in her &#8220;Reflections of a
Non-Combatant,&#8221; has finely stated the wider view:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Thought and learning, art and music, may bear certain
characteristics of the country in which they are begotten; but
they are also the products of humanity itself, or they would
make no appeal to the world at large. The monuments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>the German mind are no more robbed of their intellectual
value by the national crime of this war than German mountains
are robbed of their natural grandeur, German forests of
their solemnity, or German rivers of their width and volume.</p></div>

<p>Any other attitude is extremely likely to degenerate
into a petty jealousy that is bred of fear. This is how
Mr. H.&nbsp;G. Wells wrote of our attitude towards Germany
years ago:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>We in Great Britain are now intensely jealous of Germany.
We are intensely jealous of Germany, not only because the
Germans outnumber us, and have a much larger and more
diversified country than ours, and lie in the very heart and
body of Europe, but because in the last hundred years, while
we have fed on platitudes and vanity, they have had the
energy and humility to develop a splendid system of national
education, to toil at science and art and literature, to develop
social organisation, to master and better our methods of
business and industry, and to clamber above us in the scale
of civilisation. This has humiliated and irritated rather than
chastened us.</p></div>

<p>Such jealousy is a strangely short-sighted mistake.
No valuable or lasting peace will come till jealousy is
exorcised. There are ominous signs of the possible
triumph of a deadly Saxon insularity, but there are
other signs that give us hope. When so ardent a
combatant as Mr. Lloyd George can speak well of the
services of Germany to the world, all is not lost. It
is pleasant to be able to quote these passages from an
interview reported in the <i>Daily News</i> of January 25,
1916:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lloyd George is not among those who
imagine they are doing their country a service by
decrying everything German. &#8216;I think,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that
America and all of us should realise that there were
two Germanies before the war. On the one hand,
there was the industrial, the commercial, and the
intellectual Germany, and in a most remarkable way
she had blended the three elements. That Germany
was rendering a great service to civilisation. It was
conquering the world by the success of its methods and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>of its example, and that conquest would have proved a
very genuine blessing. It would have been the means
of saving some of the terrible waste from which most
of the social evils of humanity spring. As an ardent
social reformer, I freely confess that I myself was
learning a good deal from that side of Germany,
particularly in the direction of municipal and national
organisation.&#8217;&#8221; Mr. Lloyd George goes on to say that
the other Germany, the military Germany, had overthrown
the Germany from which he had drawn
inspiration. Our task then surely is to help to reduce
military dominance everywhere and to help to set
free that Germany whose peaceful conquest of the
world &#8220;would have proved a very genuine blessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Germany was, and still is, a Germany of
simple hearts, of men and women who can love well.
I have talked to many British-born wives of interned
men. Over and over again I have heard the same
story. &#8220;I could not have had a better husband, and the
children could not have had a better father.&#8221; That is
why many English wives have already gone to Germany
to their husband&#8217;s families.</p>

<p>It is time we got rid of grotesque caricatures of the
German people. Such caricatures always represent
the outlook of war-time, but they do not make for a
lasting peace. There is a great German people, and
that people and ours should find each other&#8217;s hearts.
I am not so much concerned as to the Germany of
brilliant science and industrious commerce. That is
good, but there is something better: It is the Germany
of loving husbands and true comrades, of true wives
and devoted mothers. It is the heart that rules the
world, and we need the true hearts in Germany,
England, France, and over all the world to recognise
each other. The one prayer for us all in every land
in these days surely is, &#8220;Lord, that our eyes may be
opened!&#8221; When we can pray that prayer, we shall
begin to see the war to a peace of the heart&mdash;the only
peace that will not be a &#8220;patched-up peace.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE MENTAL HAVOC WROUGHT BY THE WAR.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Fran&ccedil;oise Lafitte Cyon.</span></p>

<p>During the months of September, October, November,
and December, 1914, I undertook a journey in Northern France;
going first to Lille, thence to Maubeuge, and returning to England
via Brussels, Malines, Antwerp, and Holland.</p>

<p>I was at Lille on October 13, 1914, when the Germans took
the town. During the first three months of my stay in France
I was engaged in nursing work at the military hospital 105 at
Lille. In the early part of December I travelled as well as I
could, sometimes tramping and sometimes making use of
peasants&#8217; carts and local tramways, until I eventually reached
Holland.</p>

<p>It is not, however, my intention to speak much of my adventures
or of the war itself, but rather to depict, to the best of
my ability, the effect which the dreadful events of our doings
have had on the minds of the men and women I have met with
over there; be they French, Belgian, or German. This article
will be an attempt to give a series of short studies in psychology,
rather than a dramatic account of a perilous journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>I wish my readers to bear in mind at the outset that after
October 13 I was in German territory, where, from that date
onwards, I met with two kinds of people. On the one hand, the
oppressors or Germans; on the other hand, the oppressed,
namely, the French, Belgian, and a few English.</p>

<p>For a psychological study to be of value, such a distinction
is useful to begin with, for one seldom finds the same frame of
mind in the victor and the vanquished, in the oppressor and the
oppressed.</p>

<p>Whilst endeavouring to give facts, I must distinguish between
three types of people whom I met during my journey. First,
civilians, French and Belgian; secondly, the hospital staff,
doctors and nurses, mostly French, with the exception of two
German doctors; thirdly, the military, officers and men, French
and German, with a few British. I am obliged to make this
division in order to make myself clear, as the events of the
war do not seem to affect the people of these three divisions
in the same way.</p>

<p>In what follows I shall for the most part depict types.</p>

<p>I met first with the civilian population. When I reached
Lille, I found life there much as usual, excepting that all
appeared very quiet. But a few days after my arrival Lille
began to show an extraordinary and sad animation. The town,
which had already given shelter to many refugees from Valenciennes
and villages thereabouts, was suddenly crowded by the
exodus of the inhabitants of Orchies; the latter town, it was
reported, had been completely burnt to the ground by the
Germans, only thirty houses having been left standing.</p>

<p>Life in Lille became horrible. In the streets one met long
processions of miserable creatures, looking haggard and
exhausted. Here was a woman with three tiny children, two
of them in a dilapidated perambulator, the other she carried
in her arms. She looked grey with the dust of the road: I
followed her. She was going to the office of some local paper,
whence these poor refugees were directed where to go to find
food and shelter. Waiting at the door of the office were such
numbers of these worn-out human beings that many of them,
too tired to stand any longer, were sitting on the pavement
whilst the children were eating pieces of bread.</p>

<p>One morning I followed the crowd going to get bread at the
town hall. I saw a little boy of four standing at his mother&#8217;s
side while she talked with another woman. The mother&#8217;s
basket had been put down on the pavement and a round loaf of
bread was partly coming out of it. The little mite kneeled
down on the ground and, going at it with all his might, he
began to eat off the loaf in a way which told a long, sad tale.</p>

<p>But what one met with amongst one&#8217;s friends was often more
horrible than the sights in the streets. The tale of the destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>of Orchies had been believed almost everywhere before
any explanation had been forthcoming, and in these days
hatred began to rear its head when people talked of the
Germans.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they had burned Orchies,&#8221; said one of my acquaintances,
&#8220;it is because we are too tolerant with them. To brutes
we must speak only the language of brutes. We treat their
prisoners like guests; let us put them all against the wall and
shoot them and their wounded, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I replied that we should have little right to complain
of German atrocities if we did what they are reported to do, I
was looked at as too soft and as if I were a woman without
patriotic feeling. My friend told me this as politely as his
temper allowed.</p>

<p>I left him and went into the street to try to find some distraction
from his hatred. I chanced to meet a woman of
Orchies and inquired what had happened there. I give her tale
as told to me, though I have not been able to verify it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Germans,&#8221; said she, &#8220;behaved quite well the first time
they came into our town. They were kind to the children and
even gave them sweets and toys, but on their second visit they
found that some of their wounded had had their ears cut off
and they ordered that Orchies should be set on fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was monstrous,&#8221; she added, &#8220;but I know that an
African soldier was found with a necklace of sixty ears, which
he had certainly taken somewhere. This, too, was monstrous.
I do not excuse the Germans for their crime&mdash;I have lost
everything myself&mdash;but if we allow their wounded to be
mutilated at such times, what can we expect? Who can say
which side is the more barbarous? I must tell you that the
officer ordered to set fire to Orchies was also told to arrest the
mayor and some other men and to have them shot. However,
he gave them timely warning to evacuate Orchies and to make
good their escape, so no one was hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>How far this story was true I never knew, but the effect of it
on my fellow creatures I had seen too well, and I went away
bearing on my heart the words of the woman of Orchies: &#8220;Who
can say which side is the more barbarous?&#8221;</p>

<p>On October 7 we heard that the Germans were outside the
city and in many quarters fear was added to the anguish already
overburdening the hearts of so many. Yet one woman, hearing
the Germans were near, exclaimed, &#8220;Say what you like, these
men are just like our French men. War is war; you cannot
expect it to be anything but cruel and barbarous. The Germans
are no enemies of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words made a bad impression on the listeners, and it was
well that the kind-hearted soul had three brothers in the French
Army or she would have been regarded with much suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>An old lady of my acquaintance almost lost her head with
fright. &#8220;How dare they,&#8221; she said, speaking of the French,
&#8220;let the Germans take Lille?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then,&#8221; said I, &#8220;of Rheims?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Rheims, I know it was horrible! But Lille, the most
beautiful town of the North, it is a crime to make it suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whilst discussing with me the doings of the French Army
the old lady had often argued that Rheims and Arras had had
to suffer because this was necessary to the success of the French
operations. Recalling her own words, I asked: &#8220;But what
could you say if for the good of the common cause Lille must
suffer as did Rheims and Arras?&#8221;</p>

<p>But in her terror, forgetful of what she had said previously,
she only exclaimed: &#8220;Lille! It is a crime. What shall we do?
How shall we live?&#8221;</p>

<p>And I could see fear in her eyes, fear for her belongings
as well as for her life, fear which made her forget for a moment
the &#8220;good cause of this war&#8221; as she had often put it to me,
fear which made her heart give out a note of real selfishness.</p>

<p>So far as I can remember it was on October 8 that all the
gates of the city were closed, and that there was fighting on
the Grand Boulevard, the great wide thoroughfare which connects
Lille with its sister-cities of Roubaix and Tourcoing.
There was also fighting near one of the gates.</p>

<p>On the following day, on returning from my work in Hospital
105, the people with whom I was living told me of the terrible
spectacle they had witnessed when they had gone to get news
of some relations living near the gate where the fight had taken
place. One woman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The fight was on the bridge, which was covered in the
evening with the dead bodies of Germans, amongst them two
wounded men whom the Germans had left behind. By the
bridge there is an inn, and we have been told that five men,
civilians, who were there, killed the two &#8216;Boches&#8217; by
strangling them. This makes two less of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her in horror, thinking that fright had turned
her brain. I could find no words to reply. I turned to go to
my own room, when she added:</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case, the &#8216;Boches&#8217; won&#8217;t know of it for the bodies
are buried under a heap of stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left her with the words of the woman of Orchies echoing
through my brain: &#8220;Who can tell which side is the more
barbarous?&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of these people I had known before the war to be
peaceful, quiet citizens; they now appeared to me to have
suddenly turned into devils. Fear and danger had made them
crazy with hatred. Everywhere one went it was the same. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>I tried to escape it, and took refuge in the street, I seemed to
feel hatred rising from the very ground.</p>

<p>Amongst the fugitives one saw, many had run away before
even seeing a German helmet, but all were full of atrocious
tales, all were mad with hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>Not until the actual shelling of the town began did I fully
realise the havoc that fear and hatred can work! To feel helpless
while shells go whirling over one&#8217;s head at the rate of
sixty a minute, while houses are burning on either side of one,
is a horrible experience. To have to bear all these horrors
without being able to put a stop to them, is maddening. At
such moments one feels like a mouse caught in a trap. One
would have to be more than human not to feel terror.</p>

<p>We all felt this at Lille, the great majority were so panic-stricken
that they made for the gates, quite oblivious of the
fact that the gates were closed and that fighting was going on
there.</p>

<p>It is usually in these moments of supreme fear that the
lurking hatred in the soul takes full possession of it, distorting
the imagination, bringing back the most atavistic moral ideas,
giving birth to falsehoods of every description, and widening
the gulf of misunderstanding which seems to part the nations.</p>

<p>I have always known that hatred is the offspring of war. I
am well aware that ever since the beginning of the present crisis
the newspapers and the warmongers have been daily adding fuel
to the fire of hatred for fear that if the fire died out the war
would do the same. But over there, at Lille, I felt that hatred
had fallen on the hearts of many people like a fatal malediction
with which they are to be cursed all their life long and which
they will transmit to their descendants.</p>

<p>These people whom fear has driven, like cattle, from their
burning houses, who have suddenly been left without a roof
over their heads or food to eat, are not likely easily to give
up their hatred when this passion of war is a thing of the
past. Deep in their hearts will be written the word &#8220;revenge&#8221;
even though France does not lose a second Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>This same overpowering feeling of hatred I found amongst
most of the staff of the hospital where I was working, and I
was able to note at first hand the effect it had in the dealings
of the nursing staff with the German wounded.</p>

<p>After October 13, 1914, the Germans took control of all the
hospitals at Lille, and soon they were crowded with German
wounded, while, little by little, as soon as they were able to
travel, the French and British were evacuated and taken to
Germany as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>At Hospital 105 the French staff were asked if they would
agree to remain under the German authorities, and most of the
doctors and nurses elected to remain at their post. The hospital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>was controlled by the &#8220;Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des femmes de France,&#8221; who
financed it and managed the entire establishment. Many of
these women were society ladies and, with the exception of two
or three, most incompetent. Before the German occupation
their activities had mostly been of a showy character. They
were all dainty, smart, and useless, and so they remained under
German rule&mdash;those, at least, who did not run away. They
avoided nursing Germans with great skill, and overcrowded the
French and English wards. They were very diplomatic in their
dealings with the enemy, as silly and pitiful in their hatred of
the German and their cautious dealings with him as they were
in their other activities. Their hatred was of the emptyheaded
kind, but all the more dangerous for being based on frivolity
of heart and crass ignorance.</p>

<p>Side by side with them were a few intellectual women,
professors and teachers. Most of them followed in the wake
of their sisters and behaved in a similar manner. One of
them, a woman I had known before, had spent many years of
her life in Germany and had taught the German language for
nearly twenty years. Before the war she had often told me
how lovable she had found the German people, what good
friends she had in Germany and how she always enjoyed a
holiday there, so that when some of my German patients asked
me for books, I thought she would be the very person to whom
to apply for some.</p>

<p>To my astonishment she flew into a passion when she heard
my request.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want books, do they? They will soon ask for chickens and
lobsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walking into my ward, she exclaimed haughtily: &#8220;So you
are asking for books! As you set fire to everything, there are
no books left for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Very little of the nursing was done by these women, however,
who, instead of being a real help for the most part, put
spokes in the wheels of the more useful helpers. The hardships
of overwork, of long hours, of day and night duties in succession,
fell all the more heavily on the shoulders of a few willing
women, the other part of the female element proving so
unreliable.</p>

<p>These women, whose devotion never flagged, comprised three
trained nurses and nine or ten women clerks or teachers, of
quite another type to those mentioned above. It is true they
were not all free from hatred, but, if I may so express it,
theirs was almost a hopeful hatred compared with the blind
stupidity of those others.</p>

<p>Amongst the three professional nurses I remember a tall,
handsome girl of 22 or thereabouts. Hers was an ardent soul,
one of those souls which keep young in spite of advancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>years. Whatever task this girl sets herself to do she will carry
it through with skill and earnestness. Whichever cause she
champions she will do so in no light spirit, and it was thus
that she hated the Germans with the strongest hatred and yet
nursed them with utter devotion, for she was as earnest a nurse
as she was keen a patriot. There was almost a kind of
healthiness about her hatred, based as it was on deep-rooted
feelings, knowing no caution and no fear. One might hope
more for her who, fearless of consequences, could wave the
French flag and shout &#8220;Vive la France&#8221; when French prisoners
were led away, than for all the fine ladies whose little souls
were filled with great fear and ignorant hatred.</p>

<p>I remember also a small, fair nurse, silent for the most part,
but up at all times of the night as well as working hard all day.
She sometimes opened her heart to me and I found there, as
deep-rooted as her colleague&#8217;s hatred, a great and sincere love
for all men and women, an unflinching hope that in the long
run &#8220;brotherhood&#8221; will be the watchword of all humanity.</p>

<p>Amongst these hard-working women many were of this silent
type, going about with sealed lips, but with treasures of
unconscious kindliness and love hidden in their hearts, known
only to God.</p>

<p>My daily intercourse with the men on our hospital staff was
on the whole never sufficiently intimate to allow me to speak
here of their mental attitude towards &#8220;the enemy.&#8221; The
French doctors I never saw except when I was on duty, and
I had little or no opportunity of speaking with them, being only
an assistant nurse, but I recollect one little incident connected
with Professor L&mdash;&mdash;, a man of acknowledged skill in France.
At the time of which I speak, I had been transferred to a
German ward, and one day, finding myself short of boiled water
for the men to drink, I went to the chemist to ask for some.
There I met Professor L&mdash;&mdash;, who said:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you want boiled water for your friends the Germans?
What would you say if I were to put in it a few microbes of
cholera morbus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would hardly believe it of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you would not, for I am told that you are surprisingly
good to these Germans. But believe me, if it were
not for the fear of spreading the disease far and wide, this
would be the best thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have, however, no means of ascertaining that this incident
is typical of the attitude of the average Frenchman on the male
staff towards the Germans. As a matter of fact, they had very
little to do with the German wounded, as these were left
entirely in the hands of the German doctors, aided by the
French nurses.</p>

<p>After my transfer to the German wards, where we were very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>short of nurses, I soon found myself in sole charge of from
16 to 26 wounded, a burden which I felt rather too heavy for
me, as I had had but little experience in nursing previous to
the war. But it was during this time, when my duties involved
greater responsibility, that I came into closer contact with
doctors, but they were German doctors, of course.</p>

<p>I remember one of them, a small man, somewhat round, whom
we had nicknamed &#8220;pupuce&#8221; (little flea). Pupuce always
appeared to me to be kindness itself: intent on his work, good
to his men and fair to his helpers. His position as head of a
hospital where most of the men were French, was not an easy
one. He was disliked by the majority of the nurses, mostly
those who had not been willing to work under him; yet I never
saw him manifest anything but the greatest tolerance and
courtesy towards all.</p>

<p>But where one felt the smallest amount of hatred existing
on either side was amongst the men who had fought and been
wounded.</p>

<p>Being left so much alone with my German patients I got to
know them well. I never had to complain of my &#8220;Boches.&#8221;
They were so much like our own men; yes, so much like them!
They were grateful for what was done for them just in the
same way. They showed me photographs of their dear ones
and told me stories of them which made my heart beat ever so
quickly.</p>

<p>But some of them were very funny. They ate, ate, so that
one marvelled. They showed me plainly that I was to heap
potatoes and other food on their plates. It was never too
thick or too much for them. These men were of the
peasant type, heavy in features and in general appearance.
I found but few like them amongst our French men. They
seemed to feel kindly towards me. Some of them used to pat
me on the back heavily and call me: &#8220;Goode Petite Madam.&#8221;
But their kindness was cow-like, so to speak, and reminded me
of the animals when they have been well fed.</p>

<p>But, of course, all were not like that. I remember many
handsome and intelligent faces of men who seemed to have been
born for better things than butchery. Here was a young man,
a student of science, as gentle as a woman. He seemed to be
the soul of all his comrades, so great was his influence for good
over them. Day and night he was ready to help and to go to
the assistance of his fellows, so far as his own wounds would
allow him to do so.</p>

<p>There were many of this type, and many others who seemed
like children, and who could hardly be expected to realise how
they got into such a scrape. One, a young mechanic, a lad with
a bright rosy face, discovered that I was a Socialist, and, with
finger on lip, he told me that he also was one. He whispered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>the great names of Jaur&eacute;s, Keir Hardie, and Liebknecht; I
could read in his eyes the hope these names roused in him, but
I could also see that he was scarcely old enough to know his
own mind, and that he might be brutally killed ere he had
lived long enough to strengthen his hopes and to see his goal
clearly through the maze of his youthful dreams.</p>

<p>There were types on the French side corresponding more or
less closely to these.</p>

<p>It is true that the French peasant drinks wine in the place of
beer, eats less than the German, is lighter in build and in wits,
but apart from these superficial differences there is much similarity.
Under an outside show of brains, both are often of
dull and shallow intelligence. The German cracks heavy jokes
and the French cynical ones: it is difficult to choose between
them as both show little culture and an inherent commonplaceness
of mind.</p>

<p>Men of greater sensibility, of refined culture, I have found on
either side, and be they French or German, I have nearly always
found their behaviour correspond to that which I have here
tried to delineate.</p>

<p>Most of these men had seen many ghastly things, the horrors
of which often remained impressed in their eyes for days and
days after their arrival in hospital. It is often said that the trade
of war, the heavy slaughter in which they have participated,
is bound to brutalise them. I readily believe this to be so in
the case of the most vulgar types on either side, though, even
on these, the brutalising and demoralising effect of the war
seems less to be feared than amongst their corresponding types
among the civilians.</p>

<p>It is amongst the soldiers and officers of the fighting ranks
that I have found the greater readiness to fraternise with the
enemy, to acknowledge the good points of the other side.</p>

<p>The men in my ward one day having sent coffee to their
French comrades, the latter replied by sending cigarettes, and
soon both sides were conversing together. The men who have
stood face to face in the fight, who have seen their enemies
falling as bravely as they themselves have done, have little
hatred left in their hearts; but those who have suffered all
the horrors of war and who have not found either in work, or
even in participation in the war itself, a means to cool their
overheated feelings, are those who constitute the real danger
for the future work of the pacifists, as, after all, the brutalising
effect of war is not due so much to the use of physical force as
to the hatred which such physical force, bent on destruction,
brings in its wake.</p>

<p>What I say here of the men does not, however, apply to the
professional officers. Amongst the Germans these are mostly
of the aristocracy. Their haughty, scarred faces were always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>repellent to me. Luckily I was not told off to nurse them.
They had a special room of their own.</p>

<p>Once only, at lunch time, when their usual nurse was away at
her lunch, one of them beckoned to me as I was passing their
door. Thinking that he wanted something, I went up to him,
but he received me by putting out his tongue and taking a
&#8220;sight&#8221; at me, to the amusement of all his friends. This
young scamp was no other than Lieutenant von W&mdash;&mdash;, the son
of General von W&mdash;&mdash;. We all knew that he was a cad and
Pupuce himself seemed to find him rather a handful.</p>

<p>I met very few French officers during my stay at Lille, but
my knowledge of the professional military man in time of peace,
leads me to believe that the type I have described, is far from
uncommon in France. He is the embodiment of militarism anywhere,
and neither in Germany nor elsewhere will these men&#8217;s
brutal instincts be checked through war, or even through defeat.</p>

<p>After leaving Lille, and during my subsequent journey
through Northern France and Belgium, I had the opportunity
to note the dealings of the Germans with the population of
these invaded lands.</p>

<p>After the numerous accounts of monstrous atrocities which
were perpetrated over there, I hardly dare to mention here that
personally I did not meet with any of these. I do not mean to
imply by this that atrocities have not happened, but simply
that it has been my good fortune not to come across any.</p>

<p>At Lille itself, the Germans behaved decently when once in
occupation. Posters were put on the walls of the town inviting
the population to keep quiet. It is true that a few days later
fresh bills appeared, worded in very peremptory fashion,
warning the inhabitants to keep away from the bridges, railways,
and so forth, under penalty of death for disobedience.
However, to my knowledge, no disturbances occurred. There,
as elsewhere, the Germans tried to reorganise ordinary life as
quickly as possible; they helped to put out fires and to restore
quiet and order amongst the civilians.</p>

<p>At Maubeuge I met with a similar state of affairs, though I
came to this town to find that my father, one of the citizens,
had only the day before come out of prison, where the Germans
had kept him for 28 days; on a false charge of trying to incite
the inhabitants of Maubeuge against the Germans, he and two
other men had been arrested. According to their own account
the three of them were given a very fair trial and were
acquitted. My father did not in any way complain of the
treatment he had met with.</p>

<p>I must admit, however, that the three prisoners did not all
speak of their adventure in the same spirit. My father, always
quiet and cool-headed by nature, resolved to make the best of
a bad job, and having obtained paper and ink, wrote about half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>of a book whilst in prison. He found the food wholesome,
though not always plentiful, and asked my mother after his
release, to make him a pea soup like that he had had in his
cell. The other two, however, one a mere lad, the other an
old-maidish man of 50, complained bitterly of the food and
other things. While narrating his part of the story the middle-aged
man turned to me exclaiming: &#8220;Why, your father, no
one would believe that he is a good bit over 60. He took it all
so quietly, just as if he were still a young man!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not but infer from this that in times of such great
crisis and passion a man over there in the invaded parts is
often treated by &#8220;the enemy&#8221; according to the way in which
he himself behaves towards the so-called &#8220;enemy.&#8221; Coolness
of head and courtesy on the one side more often than not met
with the same qualities on the other side.</p>

<p>I suspect it was this, that, after the trial of the three,
caused the President of the Court to apologise to my father,
who had proved himself a man, but not to think of doing so
to the two other prisoners, who had been more sheepish than
human.</p>

<p>On the average, the relations between the Germans and the
inhabitants, from stories I have heard and facts I have witnessed,
might roughly be summed up in the following statement:</p>

<p>Arrogance, temper, haughtiness on the one side, provoke
arrogance, temper and haughtiness on the other; while quietness
and coolness of one party inspire the other with the same quietness
and moderation. Provided we bear in mind that it takes
less to provoke the victor than to provoke the vanquished, that
it is more easy for the former to indulge in his temper without
fear of consequences. I do not think that the atrocities perpetrated
by the Germans in Belgium, the true ones as they came
to my knowledge, and not the false ones which have been spread
by the Press, have proved in any way that the Germans have
passed the bounds of all that has been known in previous wars,
and have deserved to be banned and thrust outside the pale of
humanity.</p>

<p>In this article I have endeavoured to give a fair account of
my journey and to relate facts I have witnessed as they have
impressed themselves upon my mind. I have done so not to
pass judgment upon some of my fellow-creatures at such times
of overheated passions, but merely in order to present to
Socialists and Pacifists the enormity of their task after the
war, such as I have felt it over there.</p>

<p>It is in the hearts of the people that we shall have to work,
to bring to them seeds of love and fraternal goodwill in the
place of the weeds of hatred and ignorance which years of war
and horrors will have left in the souls of many. Everywhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>but mostly in the countries which have been devastated by the
war, be it in France, Belgium, Serbia, Poland or East Prussia
and Galicia, it is in the hearts of the majority of the civilian
population that we shall meet with the hardest task, but we
must work so that our faith be so great as really to move
mountains.</p></div>
